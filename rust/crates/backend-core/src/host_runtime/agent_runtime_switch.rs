//! The agent runtime-switch saga: change one agent's runtime driver without changing its
//! identity, losing a live session, or racing a delete.
//!
//! Switching drivers is a lifecycle transition, not a column edit. The old-runtime sessions
//! must be cleared before the `runtime` column moves, and nothing may spawn or deliver under
//! the agent while that window is open. This module orchestrates that window against narrow
//! typed ports; the durable half — the compare-and-set lock lifecycle, the committed-fact
//! seal, and the lock-fenced seat/inbox reads — lives in [`crate::host_runtime::runtime_transition`] and is
//! reused verbatim here.
//!
//! # Shape of the transition (mirrors the TypeScript `switchAgentRuntime`)
//!
//!  1. **Preflight** (no lock): the row exists, the target differs from the current runtime,
//!     the target is selectable, and a forced host catalog probe proves it is not
//!     deterministically absent. Availability is host-local truth — only a definite `absent`
//!     blocks; `present_unverified`/`unknown` defer to the daemon spawn last-line.
//!  2. **Acquire** the durable transition lock ([`begin_runtime_transition`]). A concurrent
//!     switch or an in-flight delete loses here, loudly, instead of interleaving.
//!  3. **Under the lock**: re-read the row (the preflight snapshot can go stale across the
//!     catalog round-trip); enumerate every SEAT through the lock-fenced sealed read; capture
//!     the AgentSlot presentation focus while its custody is still current; reclaim in-flight
//!     inbox leases; and clear every old-runtime session. A single clear failure aborts the
//!     lock and leaves the runtime unchanged — no partial switch is ever committed.
//!  4. **Commit** the runtime + tuning in one guarded write ([`complete_runtime_transition`]),
//!     which also releases the lock. A `Lost` commit means another attempt owns the lock now.
//!  5. **Re-drive** (post-commit): start the conversations that must resume under the new
//!     runtime. Nothing here can revert the committed transition. The known-live and sealed
//!     reclaimed conversations are always dispatched; each supplemental resume-plan read
//!     (newly-pending, oldest-pending, participation) degrades INDEPENDENTLY — a fault skips
//!     only that read and is surfaced in `resume_read_faults`, never silently zeroed — and a
//!     restart the provider refuses is counted. The AgentSlot ready-replay / inbox trigger
//!     picks up whatever this best-effort pass could not enumerate.
//!
//! # Where the effect targets come from
//!
//! The per-seat clear here is a consequence of a transition the caller already authorized
//! (route edit-admission) and that the durable lock already fenced — not a fresh user action.
//! So the saga does NOT re-run the per-seat admission ladder: it mints each sealed
//! [`RuntimeSeatTarget`] only from a [`TransitionClearCandidate`] — the sole bridge from a
//! lock-fenced sealed seat to a clear target — so every cleared scope is provably one the
//! held marker enumerated, never a caller-picked arm.
