//! The durable runtime-transition lock: the compare-and-set state machine that lets
//! one agent change runtime without losing a session or racing a delete.
//!
//! Switching runtime is not a single write. The old-runtime sessions must be cleared
//! before the `runtime` column moves, and nothing may spawn or deliver under the agent
//! while that window is open. A durable lock on the row (`runtime_transition_target`,
//! with its paired `runtime_transition_started_at`) is what holds the window closed
//! across the clear, and its compare-and-set is what makes two concurrent switches — or
//! a switch racing a delete — fail loudly instead of interleaving.
//!
//! This is a distinct write authority from the capability-neutral
//! [`crate::identity_access::agent_profile_write`] row writer, exactly as [`crate::teardown`] is: the
//! profile writer decides a per-capability column edit inside its lock, whereas this is
//! a three-step lock lifecycle — acquire, release, commit-and-release — keyed on the
//! lock columns.
//!
//! # The adapter witnesses; the domain mints the verdict
//!
//! The persistence port never mints a domain verdict. It returns a DB-observable
//! *witness* — the row the compare-and-set actually touched — and the free functions
//! here ([`begin_runtime_transition`], [`complete_runtime_transition`]) bind the
//! subject, replay the request against the witness, and seal it into the product
//! outcome. A `rows_affected == 1` proves only that *some* SQLite impl changed *a* row;
//! it cannot prove the row was the requested agent, or that the committed columns match
//! the request. So:
//!
//!  - Acquiring returns [`RuntimeTransitionLockRow`] with the `AgentId` decoded from the
//!    RETURNING row (never back-filled from the query parameter). [`begin_runtime_transition`]
//!    refuses to mint a lock whose witnessed agent/target/started-at disagree with the
//!    request — a witness that is synthetic or inconsistent with the request yields a
//!    fault, not a [`RuntimeTransitionLock`], so no clear or spawn ever runs off an
//!    unproven lock.
//!  - Committing returns the [`RuntimeTransitionAfterImage`] the write left behind, and
//!    [`complete_runtime_transition`] seals it field by field (all three tuning columns,
//!    `updated_at`, and that the lock pair is cleared) before minting
//!    [`CommittedRuntimeTransition`]. The committed `runtime` is NOT a free coordinate:
//!    it is derived solely from the sealed lock's `target`, and the after-image `runtime`
//!    must equal that target — the request carries no separate runtime to disagree with
//!    it. A wrong-agent, wrong-runtime, missed-tuning, or mis-stamped write is a fault the
//!    boundary surfaces as a safe `500`, never a success the caller acts on.
//!
//! [`RuntimeTransitionLock`] is a private-ctor ownership token minted only by a sealed
//! acquire — a caller cannot re-assemble a bare `(agent, target)` and act on a lock it
//! never acquired. The token carries `started_at`, and the adapter folds it into the
//! release/commit compare-and-set, so a *new* attempt that reacquires the same target at
//! a *different* instant gives the *old* attempt's token a different `started_at`: the
//! old token can no longer abort or complete the new lock. This is a different-started-at
//! fence, not a full ABA defense — a reacquire that lands on the *same* millisecond
//! stamp is out of scope, because `started_at` is a wall clock, not a unique attempt id.
