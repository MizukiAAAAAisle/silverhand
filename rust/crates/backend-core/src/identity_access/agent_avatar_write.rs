//! The agent avatar upload/clear use cases for `POST` and `DELETE
//! /api/agents/{id}/avatar` — the orchestration bounded context that drives the blob
//! store and the SINGLE canonical `agents`-row writer
//! ([`crate::identity_access::agent_profile_write::AgentProfileWriteUnitOfWork`]) to repoint (or clear)
//! the paired avatar columns, cleaning up orphaned/replaced blobs and firing the owed
//! `agent_changed` announce.
//!
//! ## This module owns the LIFECYCLE, not a second row port or edit algebra
//!
//! It declares no row port, no edit type, and no persistence fact of its own: the
//! canonical writer, the sealed [`crate::identity_access::agent_profile_write::AdmittedAgentProfileEdit`]
//! (minted only by `admit_avatar_assignment` / `admit_avatar_removal`), and the
//! full-column seal all live in `agent_profile_write`. Payload validation is
//! [`crate::identity_access::avatar::validate_avatar`] — the ONE authority for the empty→size→MIME
//! refusal order, the 5 MiB cap, and every `code`/`message`; this module never restates
//! a constant or a rejection table. The boundary lowercases the declared MIME before
//! handing it here. What IS agent-specific and new lives here alone: the candidate/
//! use-case shapes and the blob/write OUTCOMES.
//!
//! ## Put-then-write, with orphan/replacement cleanup carried to the boundary
//!
//! Upload order matches the product: validate first (a bad payload costs no blob
//! write), then put the FRESH blob, then repoint the row through the canonical writer.
//! An upload's decision ALWAYS assigns, so every non-`Committed` fact after the put —
//! `NoSuchAgent`, a persistence fault, an untrustworthy `Unchanged`, a cross-subject or
//! seal-mismatch `Committed` — orphans the just-put blob; each best-effort deletes it
//! and CARRIES the [`BlobCleanup`] fate so the boundary can log a leak (product maps
//! them to `404` / safe-`500` respectively). A trustworthy commit instead cleans the
//! PRIOR blob the row used to point at (if any) and announces exactly once.
//!
//! Clear decides from the before-image under the lock: a present avatar is removed
//! (→ `Committed`, prior blob cleaned, one announce), an already-absent avatar is a
//! legitimate NO-OP (`None` → `Unchanged`, no write/delete/announce). Because the
//! decision is state-dependent, the domain re-derives it against the witnessed
//! before-image: an `Unchanged` whose before was Present, or a `Committed` whose before
//! was Absent, is an untrustworthy fact (safe-`500`), never laundered into a success.
