//! Which runtimes the product OFFERS on a machine, and what one detection pass
//! found for each of them.
//!
//! ## Two authorities, deliberately not one
//!
//! [`RuntimeKind`] owns what a runtime IS: the closed set every stored value must
//! parse into, every agent may report, and every wire face renders. This module
//! owns a PRODUCT decision layered on top of that set — which runtimes a person may
//! pick on a machine, and the order the catalogue lists them in.
//!
//! The two answers move for different reasons. A runtime becomes part of the
//! vocabulary the moment a row can hold it (a decoder, a teardown fact, a host
//! resource face all need it); it becomes OFFERED only when the product decides to
//! ship a picker entry for it. Folding the second into the first would mean adding a
//! variant silently offers it, and that a product-order change edits the type every
//! stored runtime is read through.
//!
//! ## The catalogue's set and order are not the caller's to choose
//!
//! A [`RuntimeCatalog`] can only be built by [`RuntimeCatalog::from_detections`],
//! which takes exactly [`SELECTABLE_RUNTIME_COUNT`] detections and pairs them,
//! positionally, with [`SELECTABLE_RUNTIMES`]. There is no constructor that accepts
//! a set of runtimes, so no adapter and no route can answer with a different
//! subset, a different order, or a duplicate — a shorter or longer answer is a
//! compile error at the adapter rather than wire drift.
//!
//! ## The four states are the detection matrix, not wire tokens
//!
//! [`RuntimeDetection`] carries the four outcomes a local probe can reach and the
//! evidence each one has. Which `state` / `reason` strings those project to is the
//! wire boundary's answer, not this module's — the projection lives beside the DTO
//! so a new arm here is a compile error there.
