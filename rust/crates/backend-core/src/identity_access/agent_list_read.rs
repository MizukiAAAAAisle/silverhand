//! The stored facts one `GET /api/agents` read needs.
//!
//! The list face asks the SAME "who may see this agent" question as
//! [`crate::identity_access::capability::agent_view`] — once per row instead of once. This module is
//! the port for that: facts in, application structs out, no rule of its own and no
//! driver.
//!
//! ## The relation narrows; the capability decides
//!
//! A viewer-keyed query over the visibility relation can only produce CANDIDATES.
//! `can_view_agent` stays the decider and runs per row, so the list answer and the
//! single-agent answer are one authority evaluated a different number of times,
//! never a transposed second copy of the predicate.
//!
//! A candidate the capability then REFUSES on ACL grounds is not a product refusal:
//! nobody asked about that agent. It means the narrowing disagrees with the decider
//! — a fact-source defect — so it takes a named contract failure alongside the
//! lane's coordinate seals, never a quiet omission. The reverse direction, an agent
//! the relation never offered that the predicate would have admitted, is
//! unobservable from inside one request and is what the pair-matrix differential
//! exists to cover.
//!
//! ## Stage and scope stay here
//!
//! `?include_failed=1` / `?include_pending=1` widen the visible STAGE set, and
//! `?scope=owned` narrows by the agent's ACTUAL creator. Neither may reach the ACL:
//! a flag never adds an audience, and `owned` never short-circuits a viewer check.
//! Holding all three in core is what makes that inspectable in one place.
//!
//! ## Order is a fact, not a choice
//!
//! The TypeScript authority orders by `created_at ASC` and names no tiebreak, so a
//! tie is UNDEFINED here too. Making it a total order would be a product decision,
//! not a porting one: this port carries the observed clause verbatim, and its
//! fixtures use distinct timestamps rather than asserting an order the source does
//! not have.
