//! The INTERNAL self-service profile write use case for `POST
//! /internal/agents/{aid}/profile` (and the internal avatar `POST`/`DELETE`) — the
//! #2226 orchestration bounded context that drives the blob store and the SINGLE
//! canonical `agents`-row writer
//! ([`crate::agent_profile_write::AgentProfileWriteUnitOfWork`]) to apply a combined
//! `display_name` / `description` / avatar edit in ONE row unit-of-work, firing EXACTLY
//! ONE `agent_changed` announce and cleaning up any replaced/removed blob.
//!
//! ## Why a combined lifecycle, distinct from `agent_avatar_write`
//!
//! The public avatar routes ([`crate::agent_avatar_write`]) own an avatar-ONLY lifecycle.
//! This internal capability edits text AND avatar in the SAME request, and the product
//! contract (ratified) is a SINGLE atomic row write with a SINGLE announce — never the
//! avatar-then-text two-write / two-announce sequence with a partial-commit window. That
//! cannot be expressed by composing the avatar-only use cases (each fires its own
//! announce), so the combined lifecycle lives here. It declares NO row port, NO edit
//! algebra, and NO persistence fact of its own: the canonical writer, the sealed
//! [`AdmittedAgentProfileEdit`] (minted for this capability ONLY by
//! [`admit_internal_profile_edit`]), and the full-column seal all live in
//! `agent_profile_write`. It shares that canonical writer with tuning and the public
//! avatar lifecycle — no second capability-specific writer exists.
//!
//! ## Put-then-write, with transition-scoped cleanup carried to the boundary
//!
//! An avatar `Set` puts the FRESH blob before the row write (its pointer must exist
//! before the row can name it); a `Clear`/`Leave` puts nothing. The decision is replayed
//! UNDER the write lock against the locked before-image, and the domain re-derives the
//! verdict + sealing intent from the witnessed before-image after the commit — a lying or
//! buggy adapter can neither mint a refusal nor launder an unwarranted write. On any
//! non-trustworthy-commit path AFTER a put, the fresh blob is a true orphan and is cleaned
//! best-effort with its [`BlobCleanup`] fate carried — EXCEPT a durable-but-untrustworthy
//! commit, where the UPDATE persisted and the fresh blob may be referenced, so it is
//! deliberately RETAINED. A trustworthy commit cleans the PRIOR blob ONLY on an avatar
//! TRANSITION (`Set` or `Clear` off a present prior); a text-only edit never touches the
//! avatar blob even when one is present.
