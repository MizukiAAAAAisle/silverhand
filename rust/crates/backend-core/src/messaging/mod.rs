//! Messaging application boundary: the real create-message contract.
//!
//! Driver-free and transport-free. Persistence and wire projection live in
//! sibling crates; both project from the facts defined here, and neither's
//! vocabulary — statement text, status codes, wire codes, operator instructions —
//! appears in this module.
//!
//! One send reads left to right through the modules below:
//!
//! - `principal` — who a principal is: the two kinds and the stored name grammar,
//!   one vocabulary for every consumer that asks.
//! - `identity` — the identities and ordinals this system mints and publishes.
//! - `addressing` — how a body produces references, and who it therefore addressed.
//! - `command` — a request with every invariant satisfied, prepared before any
//!   transaction opens.
//! - `authority` — what the write is authorized against, read inside the atomic
//!   unit.
//! - `fact` — the single business fact of a committed send, and the typed views
//!   each delivery path reads it through.
//! - `author` — who a message reports as its author, as one discriminated value
//!   (active / deleted / unresolved) every reader shares.
//!
//! **Those seven are PRIVATE, and that is the point.** Where a type happens to live
//! is this module's business to change, so nothing outside can import
//! `messaging::command::…` and become coupled to a layout decision. Everything they
//! define is reachable at its stable `messaging::X` name through the re-exports at
//! the bottom of this file — the same names these types have always had.
//!
//! The gate on that, one case per module, because a private module is only a
//! boundary while it stays unreachable:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! use silverhand_backend_core::messaging::principal::PrincipalKind;
//! ```
//! ```compile_fail
//! use silverhand_backend_core::messaging::identity::MessageId;
//! ```
//! ```compile_fail
//! use silverhand_backend_core::messaging::addressing::AddressedPrincipals;
//! ```
//! ```compile_fail
//! use silverhand_backend_core::messaging::command::SendMessage;
//! ```
//! ```compile_fail
//! use silverhand_backend_core::messaging::authority::assert_post_authority;
//! ```
//! ```compile_fail
//! use silverhand_backend_core::messaging::fact::MessageCreatedFact;
//! ```
//! ```compile_fail
//! use silverhand_backend_core::messaging::author::MessageAuthor;
//! ```
//!
//! Public alongside them sit the concerns that own a rule end to end and are
//! consumed by name from outside: [`attachments`], [`environment`], [`freshness`],
//! [`mention_cc`] and [`post_commit`]. A refusal lives with the authority that
//! answers it, which is why `AttachmentRefusal` is in `attachments` and
//! `StaleRefusal` is in `freshness` rather than here.
