//! What a committed send owes the world afterwards.
//!
//! Everything here happens after the writer has been released, so nothing it does
//! can change what was written. That is the whole shape of this module: the send is
//! already a fact, and these are attempts to tell people about it.
//!
//! Each capability is its own trait with its own failure. A single wide port would
//! make "one failure does not affect another" a claim about this file's control
//! flow; separate ports make it a property of the dependency graph, because no
//! attempt can be reached only through another.
