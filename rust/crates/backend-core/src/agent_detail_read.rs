//! The stored facts one `GET /api/agents/{id}` read needs.
//!
//! Detail composes the SAME visibility ACL as availability
//! ([`crate::capability::agent_view`]) with a projection of the agent's own row.
//! It holds no rule of its own: facts in, application structs out, so the route
//! and its tests share one authority without a driver.
//!
//! ## One row, one snapshot
//!
//! Unlike availability there is no second host-side read: everything the detail
//! wire shows comes off the agent row and its host `LEFT JOIN`, read on ONE
//! deferred snapshot together with the two set-shaped ACL arms. The visibility a
//! caller is judged against and the values later projected to the wire therefore
//! come from ONE view of the database.
//!
//! ## The ACL input and the wire echo cannot disagree
//!
//! The creator and the stage are each ONE decoded value the ACL judges and the
//! wire echoes. Rather than trust two copies to stay equal, the bundle holds one
//! of each and hands both faces the same value:
//!
//! * The creator is a single [`UserId`] input to [`from_source`](AgentDetailFacts::from_source).
//!   The constructor is the ONLY place viewer arms are built, so it seeds the ACL
//!   creator arm from that id, and [`created_by_user_id`](AgentDetailFacts::created_by_user_id)
//!   returns the same field. The projection carries no creator of its own, so an
//!   adapter cannot admit one human and render another — the splice is
//!   unconstructable, not merely discouraged.
//! * The stage gate and the wire's `materialization_status` are the same
//!   [`MaterializationStatus`](crate::agent_lifecycle::MaterializationStatus), read
//!   back off [`AgentVisibility`].
