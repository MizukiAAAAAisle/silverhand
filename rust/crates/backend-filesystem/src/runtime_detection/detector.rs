//! One detection pass, cached for a window, owned for the life of the process.
//!
//! ## Why the cache is part of the component and not of a caller
//!
//! A pass stats dozens of directories, may start a login shell, and spawns one child
//! per offered runtime — one of which can take twenty seconds to answer. A surface
//! that asked the machine on every request would make a cheap read expensive and
//! would let a burst multiply that cost. So the window belongs to the thing that
//! knows what a pass costs: this component holds it, and every caller that shares
//! the component shares the one window.
//!
//! Cloning shares the cache: the state is behind one [`Arc`], so a factory handed a
//! clone cannot acquire a private window. Constructing a SECOND detector would, which
//! is why exactly one is built where the process is assembled and injected from
//! there.
//!
//! ## One pass at a time
//!
//! The window is guarded by a lock the pass itself holds. A request arriving while a
//! pass runs waits for it and then reads its result, so concurrent first requests
//! produce ONE walk of the machine rather than one each — the product's cache admits
//! that fan-out, and there is no reason to reproduce it.
//!
//! The window is measured from when a pass STARTED, exactly as the product measures
//! it: a pass that took twenty seconds does not thereby get a longer life than one
//! that took twenty milliseconds.
//!
//! ## Nothing about a pass can fail
//!
//! Every way a probe can go wrong is one of the four detection outcomes, so the pass
//! has no error to return: a missing binary is `Absent`, an unreadable version is
//! `VersionUnavailable`, and a probe that came apart is `ProbeFailed`. That last arm
//! is why each runtime is probed on its own task — a defect while probing one runtime
//! costs that runtime its answer, not the whole catalogue.
