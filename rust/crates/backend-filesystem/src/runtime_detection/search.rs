//! Where this machine's runtime executables might be, and which one to use.
//!
//! ## The search order IS the product's answer
//!
//! A runtime resolves to the FIRST executable found while walking the sources in
//! order, so the order below is a behavioural contract, not an implementation
//! detail. Two sources are load-bearing enough to name:
//!
//!  - **`PATH` first, whole.** Everything else is a fallback for the many ways a
//!    GUI-launched process inherits a `PATH` that a login shell would not have.
//!  - **Version-manager shims last.** A shim answers `--version` by starting a whole
//!    Node toolchain; if a real binary is on `PATH`, it wins.
//!
//! ## Per-runtime hard candidates come before any directory
//!
//! One runtime has locations that beat a `PATH` lookup outright: the codex binary
//! shipped inside a macOS app bundle starts in a fraction of the time the npm
//! wrapper takes, because the wrapper is a Node script that re-spawns the real
//! binary after a cold dyld start. Those candidates are probed before the search
//! path, in the order listed, and no version equality with the npm CLI is required —
//! installing the app IS the acceptance.
//!
//! ## Executability is the OS's answer about THIS process
//!
//! A candidate counts when `stat` says it is a regular file AND the OS says this
//! process may execute it — the two questions the product asks, in that order.
//!
//! Neither implies the other, which is why both are asked. A permission-bit test is
//! a DIFFERENT question: a file owned by this process with mode `010` has an execute
//! bit set and cannot be executed by it, so a bit test resolves a candidate the
//! product would have skipped, and the runtime is then reported installed on a
//! machine where nothing can start it. And `X_OK` alone answers yes for a directory,
//! where the bit means searchable, so dropping the `is_file` half would resolve a
//! directory named after a runtime.
