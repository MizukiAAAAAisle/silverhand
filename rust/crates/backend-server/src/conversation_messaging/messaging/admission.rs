//! Admission: what a send request must be, decided before any principal is known.
//!
//! ONE use-case, two orderable stages (@Cindy's ruling). This is the first, and it
//! owns every rule about the request's own content: shape, the UTF-8 content cap, the
//! attachment list's accepted forms and bounds, and the payload refine. It cannot see
//! a principal, an authority or a unit of work, and that is enforced by its signature
//! rather than by discipline: there is nothing in scope for it to consult.
//!
//! The second stage is [`super::execute`], which is where a principal and the write
//! unit finally appear. Splitting them this way is what lets the two doors run the
//! same rules in DIFFERENT ORDERS — the human door authorizes before it has a body,
//! the agent door validates before it resolves a target — without either door
//! carrying a second copy of a rule.
//!
//! THE TWO DOORS DO NOT ACCEPT THE SAME BODY, which is why one set of rules has two
//! entry points. Everything about the payload is shared and defined once; what differs
//! is the DESTINATION COORDINATE the body carries. The human door's body may name a
//! reply target inside the conversation it is already posting to. The agent door's
//! body must carry an absolute address, and carry it REQUIRED, because an agent's
//! credential says where it lives and never where its words go. One shape for both
//! costs a wrong destination in both directions: a reply silently flattened onto the
//! main line, or an address taken from whatever coordinate happened to be at hand.
//!
//! HOW THE SHAPE IS DECIDED, in the governance model the mounted write faces share
//! (frozen `#2236`): a typed Serde DTO owns structure — a missing required field, a
//! wrong-typed one, a present `null` where the schema said optional-not-nullable — and
//! a `garde` stateless rule owns the field predicates that need no cross-field context.
//! What is left — normalization, the domain-id parses, the attachment union's label
//! trim and uniqueness, and the "this send says something" refine — is the DTO's
//! [`TryFrom`], because each reads more than one field or hands a value to its domain
//! authority. Any of those failing is ONE semantic refusal ([`PayloadRefusal::Invalid`],
//! rendered `422 {"error":"invalid input"}`); the door never publishes a validation-issue
//! schema, and the order the rules fire in is not a wire contract. The content cap is the
//! sole exception that keeps its own answer, because the two doors word it differently.
