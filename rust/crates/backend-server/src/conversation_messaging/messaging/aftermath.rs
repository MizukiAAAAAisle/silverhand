//! The single production aftermath for a committed message send, and the write doors
//! it binds itself to.
//!
//! The write transaction returns one [`SendMessageOutcome`]. This module is the only
//! place that fans its committed half into the three core aftermath plans: mention-copy
//! effects, then exactly one of main-line or reply effects. Every component of the
//! concrete production composition is required at construction; none is optional.
//!
//! It is also the seam the production write doors come from: ONE call yields the complete
//! human and agent write sets, already bound to this aftermath. Every door reads the
//! aftermath from `&self` instead of taking it as a parameter, so the composition
//! statements that mount them have no fan-out argument to get wrong. The raw router
//! factories stay public as the component/spy substrate, so this is not a claim that no
//! other set can be built — only that building one is an explicit, visible act.

/// The production composition of the event hub, daemon lifecycle, durable mention

///
/// The type has four components because the real adapters deliberately implement
/// related narrow ports on one authority:
///
/// - `events`: direct-line, copy/message and viewer publication;
/// - `daemon`: runtime start/delivery, main/reply delivery and idle start;
/// - `mentions`: durable mentioned-viewer rows;
/// - `unread`: placement-aware unread/badge or direct-pair invalidation.
///
/// It is a HANDLE: the four components live behind one `Arc` and [`Clone`] is written by
/// hand with NO bound on them (the shape `InitiationState` already uses). That is the
/// point of the type. `#[derive(Clone)]` would ask each component to be `Clone` and
/// duplicate whatever answered, so "both send doors run the SAME aftermath" would hold
/// only while every concrete component happened to be a shared handle; a by-value
/// component would give each door private state with no compile error. Bound-free `Clone`
/// is satisfiable for ANY component set, and what it does is bump the shared `Arc` instead
/// of copying components — it states the sharing itself rather than describing today's
/// components.
///
/// The constructor is crate-private, so [`crate::foundation::scope_event_transport::ScopeEventHub::messaging_aftermath`]
/// is the only way a composition crate can obtain one. That does NOT make a second fan-out
/// impossible — the factory can be called twice, and a second hub is still reachable through
/// the public `ScopeEventHub::production`. What it removes is the quiet version: forking
/// requires explicitly constructing a second hub and a second aftermath, which is a
/// review-visible assembly rather than a swapped argument:
///
/// ```compile_fail
/// use silverhand_backend_server::conversation_messaging::messaging::aftermath::MessagingAftermath;
///
/// // Crate-private: a composition root cannot assemble a fan-out component by component.
/// let _ = MessagingAftermath::new((), (), (), ());
/// ```
///
/// The control for that gate, because a `compile_fail` block passes on ANY error and would
/// otherwise also pass on a renamed type or a bad import. It proves the same public path is
/// live AND that cloning asks nothing of the components — so reverting to
/// `#[derive(Clone)]` reddens here:
///
/// ```
