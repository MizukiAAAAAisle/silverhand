//! Authenticated destructive face for `DELETE /api/agents/{id}`: the public
//! agent-deletion cascade, behind the same visibility+authority ladder its sibling
//! writes compose, then a materialization-aware two-branch dispatch.
//!
//! ## The ladder (parity with `application/delete-agent.ts`)
//!
//!  1. PRINCIPAL — the human principal is proof the authenticating perimeter ran;
//!     its ABSENCE is a composition fault, not a product request, so it takes a
//!     fail-closed `500` reading nothing. Mounting the real bearer perimeter is the
//!     composition root's job — done by the backend-app #2234 CP3 mount.
//!  2. ID — a malformed id names no agent. Unlike the read/patch faces (which
//!     answer `404 {"error":"agent not found"}`), DELETE is IDEMPOTENT: an unknown
//!     id, an ACL-invisible row, and a row that vanishes mid-flight all collapse to
//!     ONE empty `204`, so the surface is never an existence oracle AND a repeated
//!     delete of an already-gone agent still succeeds.
//!  3. VISIBILITY — [`can_view_agent`], but widened to ALL THREE materialization
//!     stages (active, pending, failed), NOT active-only. Without the opt-in the
//!     default-active filter would `204` every delete of a non-active row, hiding
//!     the management surface that has to reach `pending → 409` and `failed → 204
//!     row-only`. Absence and a non-viewer still collapse to the same idempotent
//!     `204`.
//!  4. AUTHORITY — [`can_edit_agent`]: only the creator (or system) may delete; a
//!     caller who can merely SEE it gets `403 {"error":"forbidden"}`.
//!  5. DISPATCH by [`teardown_branch`]:
//!     - `Refused` (pending_materialization) → `409 materialization_in_progress`: a
//!       reserve→flip is mid-flight; deleting now would race the provisioning tx.
//!     - `RowOnly` (failed) → the SYNCHRONOUS teardown unit of work drops the
//!       agents row (failed rows own no dependents — no stop/purge/sweep), then a
//!       best-effort deletion announce; `204`.
//!     - `Full` (active) → the confirm gate, then the durable begin marker, then
//!       the async resumer drives the fence+purge+row-CAS to a terminal or pending
//!       outcome.
//!
//! ## The active branch: sync begin, async resume
//!
//! The confirm gate (`{"confirm": true}`) is parsed HERE, on the active branch
//! only — so a failed row with a malformed body stays `204`, never `400`, exactly
//! as the TS use case defers the parse into its active branch. Then
//! [`begin_agent_deletion`] persists the fail-forward intent BEFORE any daemon
//! work: this durable marker is the crash-recovery and new-dispatch gate, and
//! remote IO never runs inside its write lock. On the real `null→timestamp`
//! transition (`Started`) the route fires a best-effort per-AGENT availability
//! edge — the agent has just flipped out of `active`, so its viewers recompute —
//! then the resumer's `try_now` establishes the daemon fence, purge, and
//! CAS-deletes the row. A `begin` that finds the row gone/non-active/mid-transition
//! maps to the product refusal without touching the resumer or the availability
//! edge; an `alreadyPending` marker owned by a prior attempt is `409
//! agent_deletion_in_progress` unless `?retry=true` re-drives it (and does NOT
//! re-fire the edge — the flip already happened on the owning attempt).
//!
//! ## One named divergence, reachability-priced (flagged for review)
//!
//!  - **`202` pending message collapses.** The route's `202` body is
//!    `{"error": <message>, "code": "agent_deletion_pending_retry"}` — the fixed
//!    code the TS route overrides the runner's own code to, plus a message. The
//!    async resumer's [`DeletionRunOutcome`] is a payload-less enum (its owning
//!    ticket froze it so), so the daemon-specific pending messages TS passes
//!    through verbatim (workspace-not-provisioned, purge fail-closed, …) collapse
//!    to the closest per-arm string here. No client branches on the `202` message
//!    (the actionable signal is the fixed code), so this is priced acceptable.
//!    A `Faulted` outcome (a frozen non-hot-retriable internal contract fault) is
//!    NOT a `202` retry: it is a detail-free safe `500`.
