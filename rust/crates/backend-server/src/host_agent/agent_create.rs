//! Authenticated create face for `POST /api/agents`: the public agent-provisioning
//! saga — reserve → materialize on the host → provision the dependent graph — behind
//! a wire-admission gate, wrapped around the core [`create_agent`] unit of work.
//!
//! ## The ladder (parity with `application/create-agent.ts` + `routes/agents.ts`)
//!
//!  1. PRINCIPAL — the human principal is proof the authenticating perimeter ran; its
//!     ABSENCE is a composition fault, not a product request, so it takes a fail-closed
//!     `500` reading nothing. Create has NO visibility/authority ladder: any
//!     authenticated caller may create, and the principal IS the creator. This router
//!     stays UNMOUNTED; mounting the real bearer perimeter is the composition root's
//!     job. The auth gate staying pre-body matches the ratified admission ordering.
//!  2. WIRE ADMISSION (body) — parse against `CreateAgentInputSchema`: the handle
//!     grammar, the runtime enum, the reasoning-effort token shape AND its
//!     runtime/model allowlist, the fast-mode runtime allowlist, and the session-scope
//!     enum. A malformed body, a type mismatch, an out-of-range value, and any illegal
//!     combo all collapse to ONE terminal `400 {"error":"invalid input"}`. (The Zod
//!     `issues` array is deliberately dropped — the ratified `PATCH /api/agents`
//!     precedent; no consumer branches on it.) `host_id: ""` is FALSY in the TS
//!     placement check, so an empty host maps to `None` (default placement), never a
//!     named host.
//!  3. WIRE ADMISSION (Idempotency-Key header, design §14 Q1) — the header MUST be
//!     present and match `/^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}$/`. Absent/empty → `400`
//!     `idempotency_key_missing`; present-but-malformed → `400`
//!     `idempotency_key_malformed`. Body admission precedes key admission, matching TS.
//!  4. UNIT OF WORK — hand the admitted input, key, and `?retry=true` flag to the core
//!     [`create_agent`], which owns the whole saga: idempotency dispatch, in-core
//!     placement (returning a typed [`RuntimePlacementRefusal`], mapped through the ONE
//!     canonical [`placement_refusal`] authority — an improvement over the TS
//!     error-sniffing), the handle gate, the reserve INSERT, the capture-then-dispatch
//!     host materialize (the attachment gate and the command speak ONE truth about which
//!     daemon holds the host), and the flip-active + dependent-graph provisioning
//!     transaction. It returns a sealed [`CreateAgentOutcome`] or a safe-`500`
//!     [`CreateAgentFault`].
//!  5. RESPOND + EFFECTS — map the outcome to its exact HTTP body; on the `Created`
//!     arm (and ONLY it) reproject the committed agent through the canonical
//!     `agent_detail` projector and fire the best-effort post-commit effects in the TS
//!     order. `Echo` reprojects too but fires nothing (the effects ran on the original
//!     creation). Every fault is a detail-free safe `500`.
//!
//! ## Post-commit effects (parity with `buildPostCommitEffects`)
//!
//! Fired ONLY on `Created`, best-effort (a failure is logged, never flips the `201`).
//! The TS order is `[direct_pairs, announce, deliver, start]`; the split here is by
//! blast radius, not by ceremony:
//!
//!  - `direct_pairs_changed(creator, direct_line)` — agent-scoped arm ONLY, and ONLY
//!    when the creator↔agent pair was freshly minted (`pair_created`). A resolved
//!    existing line is not new to the creator, so no edge fires. An in-process
//!    broadcast: awaited inline (it cannot block on remote IO, and its order is
//!    observable).
//!  - `agent_changed(agent)` — the app-scope announce, also an in-process broadcast,
//!    awaited inline.
//!  - `deliver(destination, agent)` — wake the agent on the onboarding conversation.
//!  - `start(destination, agent)` — the runtime auto-start.
//!
//! `deliver` and `start` are remote daemon IO: each is handed to the owned aftermath
//! boundary ([`AftermathDispatch`]) as its OWN independent task, so the `201` is sealed
//! before either touches the host and one leg's panic or fault can never swallow the
//! other. The order matches TS: the agent arm fires the direct-pairs edge first; the
//! conversation arm skips it.
//!
//! ## Named divergences, reachability-priced (flagged for review)
//!
//!  - **`materializeFailed` message is synthesized per-code.** The core carries only
//!    the failure `code`, not the raw driver message TS passes through verbatim, so
//!    this route synthesizes a stable per-code string. No client branches on the
//!    message (the `code` is the actionable signal); the status map is reproduced
//!    exactly.
//!  - **A `MaterializeTransport` fault is a safe `500` (row left pending).** The core
//!    classifies only host REFUSALS into `MaterializeFailed` codes; a transport break
//!    is a fault and the row is left pending for the boot sweep, rather than TS's
//!    transport→`host_attach_pending`/`materialize_timeout` classification + flip.
//!  - **`corruptGraph` is a detail-free bare-text `500`**, not the TS JSON
//!    `{error:message, code:'internal_error'}`. All faults share the lane's bare `500`.
//!  - **`NameTaken` folds the two TS messages into one** fixed `agent name already
//!    exists` (code `agent_name_taken`), since the core carries no message.
