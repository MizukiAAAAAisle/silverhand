//! Authenticated write face for `PUT /api/agents/{id}/runtime`: the dedicated
//! runtime-transition command that changes one agent's driver without changing its
//! identity, losing a live session, or racing a delete.
//!
//! Runtime is deliberately NOT part of generic `PATCH`: switching drivers is a
//! lifecycle transition (lock delivery, clear every old-runtime session, install the
//! target runtime + tuning under one guarded commit, then re-drive). This route is the
//! thin authenticated shell around [`switch_agent_runtime`]; the durable orchestration
//! lives in the core saga and its typed ports, all injected here.
//!
//! The ladder mirrors the sibling public write face ([`super::agent_patch`]):
//!
//!  1. VISIBILITY ([`can_view_agent`], active-only) — absence, a caller outside the
//!     ACL, and a non-active stage all collapse to ONE `404 {"error":"agent not
//!     found"}`, so the surface is never an existence oracle.
//!  2. AUTHORITY ([`can_edit_agent`]) — only the creator (or system) may change it;
//!     anyone who could merely see it gets `403 {"error":"forbidden"}`.
//!  3. WIRE ADMISSION — `SwitchAgentRuntimeInputSchema`: `.strict()` (serde
//!     `deny_unknown_fields`), all four tuning keys REQUIRED (each nullable via the
//!     frozen [`RequiredNullable`] wire arm, so a missing key is a native decode fault
//!     that cannot silently select a default, while an explicit `null` is the caller's
//!     "target driver's default"), `model` trimmed and non-empty-or-null, plus the two
//!     cross-field tuning-legality refinements against the TARGET runtime. Structural
//!     faults keep their native `Json` rejection (400/422/415); every SEMANTIC fault
//!     collapses to ONE terminal `422 {"error":"invalid input"}` (the Zod `issues` array
//!     is dropped, matching the ratified `PATCH` precedent — no consumer branches on it).
//!
//!     Body extraction is framework-owned and runs BEFORE this handler, so a STRUCTURAL
//!     body fault precedes the visibility/authority gates. Error ORDER is not a parity
//!     gate (shiki, per the anchor + sibling `agent_patch`): the body fault is
//!     agent-independent, so it never distinguishes an existent from an absent agent, and
//!     the anti-enumeration 404 still owns every existence-revealing outcome. The
//!     cross-field `TryFrom` (target-runtime legality) runs after authority, as before.

//!  4. SAGA — hand the validated request to [`switch_agent_runtime`]. Its product
//!     failures render as the TS `{"error":<message>,"code":<code>}` envelope at the
//!     status each arm carries; the availability faults render exactly as the daemon
//!     data-plane faults elsewhere in this crate. An internal invariant break
//!     ([`SwitchAgentRuntimeError::Fault`]) is the lane's fail-closed bare `500`.
//!  5. PROJECT — reproject the committed row through the shared canonical face and
//!     return `{ agent, cleared_sessions, restarted_conversations, restart_failures }`.
//!
//! ## `resume_read_faults` is an operational signal, never a wire field
//!
//! The saga's best-effort post-commit re-drive counts every supplemental resume-plan
//! read it had to degrade past in `resume_read_faults`. The committed switch stands
//! regardless, so this count is NOT part of the response contract (the TS
//! `SwitchAgentRuntimeResponse` has no such field). But a silent `0` would hide an
//! aftermath fault, so the boundary surfaces a non-zero count as a `tracing::warn!`
//! operational signal here — the one place that observes the committed outcome.
//!
//! Like the sibling faces, the human principal is proof the authenticating perimeter
//! ran; its ABSENCE is a composition fault (fail-closed `500`, reads nothing), not a
//! product request. Mounting the real bearer perimeter and the concrete ports is the
//! composition root's job — done by the backend-app #2234 CP4 mount.
