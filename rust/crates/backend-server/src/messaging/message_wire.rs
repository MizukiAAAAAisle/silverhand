//! The one projection of a committed message onto the wire, shared by every door and
//! frame that must show the same row.
//!
//! WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE, not a pair of private helpers in [`super::ack`]: the
//! person's acknowledgement ([`super::ack::send_ack`]) and the conversation-scope
//! `message` broadcast frame (the post-commit
//! [`silverhand_backend_core::messaging::post_commit::CommittedMessagePublication`]
//! projector) are the SAME row seen by two audiences. The renderer runs one idempotent
//! apply seam over both, so a second projection here would make the sender's own view
//! converge differently from everyone else's — the exact hazard the ACK door's contract
//! warns against. This is a SINGLE PROJECTOR AUTHORITY, invoked independently by both
//! audiences: the ACK door and the broadcast frame each call it and get an equal `Value`,
//! not one value physically placed twice. What forbids them from diverging is the three
//! together — this one projector, both audiences genuinely consuming it, and an exact
//! integration gate that locks the two whole JSON payloads projected from the same
//! committed fact
//! ([`crate::scope_events`]'s `the_ack_is_the_conversation_frame_plus_a_sender_only_diagnostic`,
//! which drives the real broadcast door and the real ACK off one committed send, on both
//! the main-line and reply arms). A shared helper alone would not; it is the gate that
//! proves it.
//!
//! The ACK is a STRICT SUPERSET of this shape: it appends `unresolved_references`, which
//! has an audience of one and never rides the broadcast. This module owns exactly the
//! shared row and its reply sidecar — nothing sender-only, nothing path-specific.
//!
//! THREE DIFFERENT WAYS EMPTINESS IS SPELLED, and they are not interchangeable:
//! `metadata`/`attachments` are null together when a message carries none, an unlabelled
//! attachment OMITS `label` rather than sending null, and `reactions`/`linked_task` are a
//! structural null on a row inserted this instant.
