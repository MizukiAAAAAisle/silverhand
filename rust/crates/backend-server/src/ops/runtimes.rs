//! `GET /api/runtimes` — which agent runtimes the machine THIS process runs on has.
//!
//! Whether there is a machine to ask about at all is a DEPLOYMENT fact, and it is
//! decided ONCE, at composition, by which router is mounted — not per request:
//!
//!  - An embedded backend has a co-located daemon host, so its machine is a machine
//!    agents run on. It mounts [`detecting_router`], which holds the process's one
//!    runtime detector and projects a detection pass.
//!  - A standalone backend is control-plane only: it has no co-located host, so the
//!    machine it runs on is not one any agent runs on. It mounts
//!    [`control_plane_router`], which has no detector to hold and can only refuse with
//!    `503`. It cannot shell out to look for binaries it would have no use for, because
//!    it was never handed anything to shell out WITH.
//!
//! This is a structural port of the product's `if (standaloneMode(ctx)) return
//! hostRuntimeDisabledResponse(...)` guard. The control-plane refusal is the same
//! `503`, but instead of a runtime branch inside one handler — which would require the
//! detector to be present in BOTH deployments and rely on the branch never being
//! mis-taken — the two deployments are two routers, and the standalone composition
//! never constructs a detector in the first place. A control-plane server that probed
//! its own machine is not a bug this route can commit: there is no detector on the
//! `control_plane_router` to probe.
//!
//! The detection pass cannot fail: every way it could go wrong already has an arm, so
//! this route has no `500` path and a broken probe cannot take down the surface that
//! reports it.
//!
//! ## The detector is a process-lifetime singleton, not a route dependency
//!
//! One pass spawns a process per offered runtime, so the product caches a pass for
//! thirty seconds. That cache is a property of the machine being asked about, not of
//! any request or any route, so it lives in ONE component the composition root builds
//! once ([`silverhand_backend_filesystem::runtime_detection::MachineRuntimeDetector`])
//! and [`detecting_router`] merely receives. A cache built here — per factory, per
//! request, or as a second layer in front of the port — would either duplicate the
//! window or reset it, and either way the thirty seconds would stop meaning what it
//! says.
//!
//! ## This is the LOCAL machine, never a daemon's
//!
//! `host_control::runtime_catalog` answers the same question about a REMOTE machine, by
//! asking its daemon over the control channel, and its rows are bound to a
//! `(host, daemon instance)` coordinate. This face has no coordinate to bind: the
//! answer is about the process's own filesystem. The two must not share an
//! implementation — one machine's catalogue rendered as another's is exactly the
//! confusion the coordinate binding exists to prevent.
//!
//! ## The wire keeps a narrower vocabulary than the detection does
//!
//! `RuntimeCatalogResponseSchema` carries `detected_at`; this route's registrar sends
//! only `{ runtimes }`, because the field would tell a client the age of a cache entry
//! it cannot refresh. The port is likewise `detected_at`-free: a stamp nobody may read
//! is not a fact worth carrying to the boundary.
//!
//! ## Authentication
//!
//! Unlike the other three root faces, this one is NOT anonymous: in the product it sits
//! behind the bearer middleware (`app.use('/api/*')`) with no allowlist entry, so an
//! anonymous request is refused `401` before reaching the handler. The composition
//! mounts both routers behind the human-session perimeter accordingly; this module owns
//! only the answer a request receives once admitted.
