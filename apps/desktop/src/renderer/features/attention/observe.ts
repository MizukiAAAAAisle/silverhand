/**

 * chokepoint for §5.3 source_ref-out (#task:1231 phase B). Every clear path
 * (per-row hover-✓, on-open dismiss, Mark all read) funnels through here, so the
 * route lives in exactly one place.
 *
 * Routed by `kind` (the source_ref MECHANISM), NOT `salience` (the DISPLAY
 * tier) — these are DIFFERENT axes. A DM positional unread is `kind:'unread'` but
 * `salience:'directed'` (directed-grade importance, positional mechanism); it
 * still eliminates via the STREAM CURSOR, never a notification. Branching on
 * salience would route DM unread to the notification path, find no
 * `notification_id`, and silently drop the most attention-worthy unread from both
 * hover-✓ and Mark-all (Cindy phase-B blocker). So:
 *   - `mention` / `agent_failed` → by `notification_id` (a directed dismiss sets
 *     that one notification's `read_at`; it never reverse-advances a cursor, §3).
 *   - `unread` (mainline, thread, OR DM) → an EXPLICIT stream clear to head
 *     (`explicitStreamClearHead`): clearing without opening has no seen-seq to
 *     pin, so `stream_head` marks to now and knowingly tail-swallows (§2, R3).
 *     MAY carry a thread root — explicit thread clears are legal on the §9.10
 *     caller-intent axis, unlike the AUTO `at_seq`-only path.
 *
 * Returns null only for a malformed notification-backed item with no
 * `notification_id` — callers skip a null source rather than emit a bad clear.
 *
 * Written as an EXHAUSTIVE switch on `kind`: a future `ActivityItemKind` (e.g. a
 * v2 notification-backed `task_needs_review`) must declare its eliminate route
 * here. The `never` guard makes TS fail to compile until it does, so a new kind
 * can never silently fall through to a stream clear.
