/**
 * Wire mapping for the board read faces (#task:1884) — the pure half of the
 * board's data layer: `TaskFilters` (the UI's filter model) → the query params
 * and cache keys of `/api/tasks/board/{column,counts,facets}`.
 *
 * Kept separate from the hooks so the mapping is unit-testable without React
 * Query, and so ONE definition serves all three faces: the shared filter axes
 * are built once (`boardFilterParams`) and each path appends only its own
 * params. A per-face param builder would let the pane's column and its counts
 * disagree about what "the current filter" means — the board would then show a
 * total that its rows contradict.
 *
 * Cache keys live UNDER the `['tasks', …]` root on purpose. Every existing task
 * mutation already invalidates that root, so the board is refreshed by
 * construction rather than by a list of call sites kept in sync by hand (and the
 * viewer-local key classification in `features/channels/viewer-channel-removal`
 * keeps covering it — a NEW root there would go red in its smoke test).
