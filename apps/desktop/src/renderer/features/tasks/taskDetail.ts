 *   - `source` / `created_event` → jump to the carried viewer-resolved `ref`.
 *   - `unavailable`              → `null`: nothing to navigate to (no source and
 *                                   no resolvable event, OR a declared source the
 *                                   viewer can't read). The caller HIDES the
 *                                   affordance — a declared source never silently
 *                                   falls back to the event.
 *
 * `nav` is per-viewer and only present on the resolved detail, so the caller
 * passes `detail` once the read succeeds; `null` here means "render no button".
 *
 * `workspaceId` rides ONLY on the workspace arm — a pair-placed task carries no
 * workspace coordinate. That is not a reason to suppress the jump: the caller
 * resolves a workspace-less `channelId` through the viewer's pair carrier
 * (`directPairIds` → `nav.toDirect`), and `nav.ref.conversation_id` already holds
 * the pair conversation id for a DM task. So both placements navigate whenever
 * the server resolved a ref; only `unavailable` returns `null`.
 *
 * `TaskJumpTarget.channelId` keeps its name on purpose — it is this handler
 * boundary's own vocabulary, shared with every other jump caller. The wire field
 * is `conversation_id` because a pair task's coordinate is not a channel; that
 * asymmetry is a renderer-side naming debt, never an argument for renaming the
 * wire back.

 *     conversation; the route answers 404 for both). TERMINAL: no retry can fix
 *     it. The modal still stays open with an explanation and an explicit Close —
 *     silently stripping a pointer the user just clicked leaves them with no
 *     account of what happened (the `?side` placeholder settled this).
 *   - `unreachable` — the request never reached the backend
 *     (`ApiError.kind === 'backend_unreachable'`). The global `AppStatusBanner`
 *     already owns that signal AND its Retry, so the modal only explains itself
 *     and adds no second, narrower retry button.
 *   - `transient` — any other HTTP failure (5xx, malformed reply). The query
 *     client is `retry: 1` + `refetchOnWindowFocus: false`, so nothing re-reads
 *     this on its own: the modal MUST carry its own Retry or the pointer is
 *     stuck until the user navigates (Cindy review).

/**
 * What the detail modal renders, as ONE exhaustive discriminant.
 *
 * Failure classification and "is there a body to paint" are two INDEPENDENT
 * axes, and both are real: TanStack keeps the previous `data` when a background
 * refetch fails (`query.js` spreads the old state into the `error` action), so
 * `isError && data !== undefined` is a normal state for an open modal whose
 * exact-key refresh just failed. Branching on the body first — `detail ? body :
 * panel` — silently swallows the failure axis: a 5xx refresh kept painting a
 * body with no reachable Retry, and a 404 kept painting authority the server has
 * just disowned (Cindy BLOCKER 4).
 *
 * So the two axes are resolved TOGETHER, here, and the renderer becomes a
 * `switch` over the result. `data` never decides the TIER (that is the failure's
 * job) — it only decides the SHAPE within a tier:
 *
 *   - `not_found`         — failure wins outright: the stale body is not painted
 *                           even when we still hold one. Terminal; the corner ✕
 *                           is the only exit and the URL pointer survives.
 *   - `transient_*`       — a Retry is reachable whether or not a body is shown.
 *   - `unreachable_*`     — with a body: keep reading it, and let the ONE
 *                           app-status banner own the connection signal (a
 *                           second copy of it here would be a second surface
 *                           claiming the same fact, and a second Retry owner).
 *                           Without one: still a non-success state — a spinner
 *                           that will never resolve is a lie.
 *   - `loading`           — a distinct kind, so "permanent loading" is not
 *                           expressible for any failure tier.
