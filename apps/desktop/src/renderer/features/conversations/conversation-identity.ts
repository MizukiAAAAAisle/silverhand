/**
 * WHAT a conversation id names, across every placement — the renderer half of
 * #task:2038 (ruling A).
 *
 * There are two faces, and neither one alone can answer the question:
 *
 *  - `GET /api/conversations/:id/ref` is the WORKSPACE arm and only that. Its
 *    404 for a workspace-less placement is the correct answer, not a gap
 *    (`ConversationRefSchema.placement_kind` is `z.literal('workspace')`, so a
 *    private line is not even expressible in that DTO).
 *  - `GET /api/direct-pairs` is the only face that can name a `direct_pair`, and
 *    it is a COMPLETE SET for the viewer — no pagination, no cap, no truncation
 *    (that contract is written down beside the DTO and pinned by
 *    `tests/routes/direct-pairs.test.ts`). Completeness is what makes an
 *    ABSENCE decisive: the viewer is not an endpoint of it, so the reference
 *    may degrade to inert text.
 *
 * Composing them here — once — is what keeps the `#conv:<id>` chip and the
 * `?side=<id>` pane from drifting: before this, both read the workspace face
 * alone, so every private line rendered as "deleted or never existed" while
 * sitting in the viewer's own DIRECT MESSAGES list.
 *
 * Precedence, and why:
 *
 *  1. a pair row IN HAND wins outright. It is the viewer's own row, and the
 *     workspace face necessarily 404s for the same id, so there is nothing to
 *     wait for and nothing to reconcile.
 *  2. the workspace face's own answers (200 / 403) are terminal. A 403 says the
 *     conversation IS in the workspace arm and refuses; a pair cannot 403.
 *  3. only a 404 consults the pair face, and it may claim `not_found` ONLY once
 *     that face has answered. This is the whole bug: a 404 arriving before the
 *     pair list has answered used to be reported as deletion.
 *  4. a workspace read that FAILED (5xx / transport, retry budget spent) settles
 *     into `unresolved` — never `loading` (a skeleton with nothing behind it) and
 *     never `not_found` (it proves nothing, so it may not borrow the
 *     completeness contract that licenses a claim about deletion).
 *
 * NOTE on retained rows. This module renders from rows it holds even while a
 * refetch is in flight — the opposite of {@link
 * import('@/lib/chat-place-restore').directPairAuthorityFromQuery}, which
 * collapses retained rows to `pending` on purpose. The two are asking different
 * questions: RESTORE routes the viewer somewhere and a navigation cannot be
 * taken back, so it may only act on a re-answered list; LABELLING draws a chip
 * that is already on screen, so discarding held rows would blink every DM
 * reference back to `#conv:<id>` on each invalidation of the list. Same
 * `ready > resolving` precedence as `projectDirectPairPane`.
