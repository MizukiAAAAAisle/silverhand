// #task:2039 — the pane's placement is read ONCE, here. Four dogfood findings
// came from four components each guessing it (`workspaceId === null`, the route,
// a local boolean), so the evidence this file owes is not "the DM header shows a
// face" (that is UI, untested by rule) but that the projection is:
//   1. TOTAL over the stored placement union — a placement with no pane mode must
//      land in `unsupported`, never fall through into channel chrome;
//   2. BIDIRECTIONAL — mode → placement inverts the projection, so a rule keyed
//      by placement and a rule keyed by mode (capabilities) cannot drift into two
//      different answers for the same conversation;
//   3. EXHAUSTIVE per capability — every capability is asserted in both
//      directions: what a mode grants, and which modes grant it. A new mode that
//      quietly inherits `hasRoster` fails the second half.
//   4. A READ GATE, not paint (@Cindy's review): the capability has to turn the
//      roster QUERIES off at the source. A surface that fires them and then
//      renders nothing because a pair happens to have no roster row has moved its
//      capability into the data, where the next placement with a non-empty roster
//      silently inherits channel behaviour.
