/**
 * Activity — the human's "queue waiting on me" (#task:1227). Read-side
 * projection of `listActivity`: the server returns the list already filtered
 * (§6), per-(viewer,message) de-duped (§7) and salience-sorted (§13.2). The
 * renderer renders it AS-IS and never re-scores; the three filter chips slice it
 * purely client-side.
 *
 * v1 UI scope = GLOBAL: one list spanning every workspace. Each row is a LIST
 * CARD in the Saved-item visual language — NOT an alert feed: no left icon box,
 * no left salience rail, items spaced apart, themed border, forza6 poster hover
 * via the shared `data-collection-card` hook. Salience is carried by the two sections
 * (Requires attention / Subscribed), not by a per-row border. Location reads
 * through real identity icons on the where-line.
 *
 * Row structure is SOURCE-FIRST (server-resolved fields only; never a
 * client-stitched message cache), now ICON-LED so location reads at a glance:
 *   - row 1 = WHERE, dispatched on `location.kind` (#task:2115) because Activity
 *     spans BOTH placements: a `workspace_channel` draws workspace icon + name,
 *     then channel icon + conversation `title`; a `direct_pair` draws the
 *     COUNTERPART's face + name and NO workspace segment (a workspace-less pair
 *     has no such coordinate to draw, and one is never fabricated). The icons are
 *     the canonical identity primitives (`WorkspaceIcon`; `Hash` with the
 *     `data-channel-icon` theme hook; `AuthorAvatarView` for a counterpart), NOT
 *     raw glyphs — so forza6 paints them as its `W`/`#` posters instead of
 *     generic lucide shapes. The old "Channel/Mention/Thread" text label is
 *     dropped: real icons + the thread glyph (row 2) + the sender (row 3) carry
 *     that signal now.
 *   - row 2 = SUBJECT: thread → a thread glyph + `thread_root_preview` (the root
 *     summary it belongs under); else → `preview` (the message excerpt).
 *   - row 3 = THREAD reply: `preview` (the triggering reply), shown only when
 *     row 2 already carries the thread root summary. The sender (avatar +
 *     display_name) lands here once the backend resolves `preview_sender` on the
 *     anchor message (additive DTO field).
 *
 * Clearing (§5.3 source_ref-out) — by EXPLICIT fields, never by parsing `id`,
 * and routed through one chokepoint (`activityItemSource`):
 *   - mention / agent_failed (directed) → mark the `notification_id` read.
 *   - unread (ambient)                  → advance the stream cursor via an
 *     EXPLICIT stream-head clear (#task:1231 phase B; knowingly tail-swallows, §2).
 *   Each row exposes a hover-✓ that clears WITHOUT navigating. (A header
 *   "Mark all read" that batched the visible list in one `observe()` call was
 *   removed from the UI — #task:1446 — pending a new home; `useMarkActivityAllRead`
 *   and its batch semantics are kept for when it returns.) Navigating to a source
 *   still clears it too (directed on click; ambient via open-time mark-read).
 *
 * `kind=task` is intentionally NOT in Activity v1:
 * an `in_review && member` projection is a standing mirror of the task panel's
 * In-review column, not a transient attention event — it has no other home only
 * mentions/unread do, so tasks stay in the task panel. Task re-enters Activity in
 * v2 ONLY via a real event source (notification-backed `task_needs_review`,
 * read-cleared), never a status mirror. See `docs/activity-lifecycle-v1.md`.

 *       inside a DM is still a start failure, so placement never displaces it.
 *    2. otherwise → the placement's own identity (#task:2115):
 *       - `direct_pair` → the COUNTERPART's face, through the pair SSOT
 *         (`presentCounterpart` → {@link AuthorAvatarView}), in the same

 *         where-line's height does not move between placements.
 *       - `workspace_channel` → the `#` channel sticker.
 *
 *  The `location.kind` test itself happens ONCE per row, in
 *  {@link resolveRowLocation} — this component consumes its result (`counterpart`
 *  non-null ⟺ the DM arm) precisely so a second copy of the discriminant cannot
 *  drift out of agreement with the first, which also draws the row's NAME and
 *  builds its jump target.
 *
 *  Keyed on PLACEMENT, never on the roster (#task:2076 / #task:2077): a workspace

 *  every state it could reach — within a workspace the only rows it matched were an
 *  agent space's fixed-roster DM/Onboarding CHANNELS. Roster answers a capability
 *  question (can members change); identity is placement's to answer. That judgment
 *  is why the DTO's discriminant is the placement and why it still carries no
 *  roster field at all (see `ActivityLocationSchema`).
 *
