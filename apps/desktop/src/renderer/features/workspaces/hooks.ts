 *   the attention badge roll-up (below) and the favorites list. `metadata_changed`

 * Why `added` reaches FAVORITES (#task:1889, @Cindy MUST FIX): a star is stored on

 * the mute preference below. Re-joining a workspace therefore makes starred rows
 * reachable again, and no `workspace_channels_changed` is emitted for it — without
 * this the STARRED section stays short until a remount.
 *
 * Why `added` reaches the roll-up (#task:1870 / #task:1877, Cindy review): a
 * workspace the viewer just joined has no unread of their own, so the old reading
 * was "its badge is necessarily 0, and absent ≡ 0, so the loaded roll-up is
 * already right". That discount died when the roll-up gained
 * `muted_workspace_ids`: the mute preference row deliberately OUTLIVES a
 * membership removal so a re-join restores the viewer's earlier choice, so a
 * re-join changes the roll-up while every number in it stays 0 — and the rail's
 * muted marker would stay missing until some unrelated attention event happened
 * along. `removed` needs nothing here: it is settled by the removal contract's
 * targeted local purge, which is cheaper than refetching a workspace that is gone.
 *

 *     + conversation-ref cache entries — a private channel is invisible to a
 *     non-member and must not stay resolvable on any read path (§12 read
 *     authority); the primary pane is navigated away by the caller.
 * Rejects on the typed 403/409 (`not_member` / `channel_archived` /
 * `channel_owner` / `last_human_member`). The settings modal disables Leave from
 * the carrier, so a rejection is defensive only; on failure the caches are
