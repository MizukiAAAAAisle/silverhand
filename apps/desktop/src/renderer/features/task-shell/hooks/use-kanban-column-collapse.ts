/**
 * Per-column collapse state for the task kanban (global NavRail section +
 * per-conversation Tasks tab share one store, so toggling in one surface
 * reflects in the other within the session).
 *
 * Persistence is deliberately **in-memory only** (#task:1169, Alice + Cindy
 * review): column collapse is a per-viewer UI preference of the same family as
 * list-sort mode/rank, whose persistence model is already fixed to
 * server-side viewer-scope in `docs/list-sort-v1.md` ("not localStorage —
 * Silverhand is multi-surface; localStorage would split per surface").
 * Reaching for localStorage here would (a) fork that state per
 * desktop/web/standalone surface and (b) open a second persistence paradigm
 * that drifts from list-sort. So we keep zero cross-session persistence: a
 * user's toggles live in a module-level store and are shared across the global
 * section, the per-conversation Tasks tab, and navigation **within the
 * session**, but a window
 * reload / fresh session resets to the default (Closed collapsed). It's the
 * archival terminal column, so that default is sensible.
 *
 * The public interface (`isCollapsed` / `toggle`) is the contract: if
 * "remember my expanded columns" ever becomes a real requirement, swap the
 * module store below for the server-side viewer-scoped read model — the call
 * sites in TasksSection / ChannelTasksTab don't change.
