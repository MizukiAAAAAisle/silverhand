/**
 * Task detail modal — the ONE surface for reading a single task, opened by
 * `?task=<task_id>` in the URL (#task:1715): a task card on either board
 * surface, an inline `#task:<n>` chip in chat, or a cold deep-link all write
 * that one pointer, so there is a single modal instance at app level with a
 * single state. Reads the full body + edit-provenance byline on demand.
 *
 * Because a chip click no longer opens the tasks board first, the modal may be
 * the only task surface on screen. "View in conversation" sits beside the close
 * ✕ in the corner cluster; it does not close the modal from here — the surface
 * that navigates decides what happens to the `?task` pointer, so there is exactly
 * ONE owner for the action (Cindy BLOCKER 3) instead of a close racing a route
 * change. A cold deep-link shows the detail only; there is no jump-to-board
 * affordance (shiki 2026-08-21 — the reveal machinery was retired, #task:2124).
 *
 * WHAT IS RENDERED is one exhaustive decision, `resolveTaskDetailView` — failure
 * tier and "is there a body to paint" are independent axes and both are real
 * (a background refresh can fail while the previous body is still cached). The
 * `switch` below is total over that union, so no branch order can swallow a tier.
 *
 * A read that doesn't resolve gets a COMPACT single-column shell, not the wide
 * two-column one: the wide shape exists to seat a description beside a metadata
 * column, and neither exists yet. The URL pointer is never stripped on failure —
 * the user clicked that reference, so it stays addressable until they close it
 * (same principle as `SideUnresolvedPlaceholder`; the corner ✕ is the explicit
 * close, so the panel adds no second Close button).
 *
 * Editing is IN PLACE and PER FIELD: a pencil beside the title / description
 * turns just that region into an inline editor (no second modal, no global
 * edit mode). Each editor saves on blur and submits ONLY its own field as a
 * plain last-write-wins update — the omitted field stays untouched. While a
 * field is being edited the modal refuses close requests (an outside-click / ✕
 * only fires the blur-save; a validation/request failure keeps the draft in the
 * open editor) and the jump icon is hidden. "View in conversation" is the modal
 * close ✕'s TWIN — same corner-button skin (and forza6 poster-sticker), sitting
 * in the top-right action cluster just left of the close — consuming the
 * viewer-resolved `nav` discriminant (source → source message, else →
 * task-created event; hidden entirely when nav is `unavailable`).
