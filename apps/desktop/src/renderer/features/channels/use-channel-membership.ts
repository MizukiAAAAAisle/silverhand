/**
 * Resolve a channel's per-viewer membership to the fail-closed three-state,
 * shared by `ChannelView` (the primary/side pane) and `App` (for the open
 * `ThreadPanel`) so both consume the SAME authority instead of each collapsing
 * it their own way. The carrier's own `is_member` wins when present (a
 * discovery-union list item or a channel-detail response); a carrier that lacks
 * it — a cross-workspace `?side` ref / deep link — is `unknown`, resolved by a
 * channel-detail fetch (a read allowed to anyone who can view the channel). The
 * fetch is `enabled`-gated to the `unknown` case only, so a member hot path
 * (carrier already stamped) fires zero extra network and never flickers.
 *
 * `channelId` null (no channel selected) leaves the fetch disabled → `unknown`.
 *
 * `directPair` switches the whole derivation off (#task:2035): a pair has no
 * membership axis and no channel to fetch detail for, so the caller passes its
 * `read_only` and gets `directPairGate`. The reported `membership` is `'member'`
 * — a PROJECTION of "the viewer is an endpoint" onto this three-state axis for
 * the consumers that only ask "may member-scoped surfaces mount", not an
 * `is_member` inference from a placement axis (the caller states the placement;
 * the row's existence in the viewer's own pair list is the proof).
