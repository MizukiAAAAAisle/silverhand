// SINGLE entry for "set fields on an existing message row, by id, across every
// currently-DISPLAYED projection that holds it". Before this, each row-patch
// event handler (reaction, task_changed) hand-enumerated which projections to
// write — and a new handler could (and #task:1269 item 1 did) forget one,
// silently dropping live patches for that projection. The fix is by-construction:
// handlers no longer enumerate projections; they hand this seam an idempotent
// per-row `patchRow` and it fans out to all three message projections, each
// gated on {active observer AND cache actually holds the row} — never
// bootstrapping an absent window.
//
// SSOT for "which displayed projections hold M" = React Query observer count +
// cache content (NOT the transport interest registry #1260, a bandwidth-scope
// concern that can't answer "is M in this window"). The per-projection walkers
// below are deliberately NOT exported: the only way to patch a message row is
// through this seam (a by-construction fence — you can't call a function that
// isn't exported), backed by a source-scan fence forbidding row-patch handlers
// from touching the reader gates / `setQueryData` directly. `applied` = ≥1
// displayed projection was actually written; it is the SYNCHRONOUS commit signal
// (reaction/task stay on the #1263 hybrid boolean gate, off the async `message`
// allSettled path). Fire-and-forget refreshes (reactors popover, task-by-number
// detail) are NOT this seam's job and never count toward `applied` — they
// self-heal authoritative-on-open.
//
// S1 note: only the resolver (which projections + membership) is React-Query
// specific; the seam SIGNATURE is the S1 projection-recovery shape, so S1 can
// swap the resolver internals without touching callers.
//

// HTTP write ACK — does not). Both resolve their projections through the ONE
// enumeration {@link heldMessageProjections}; that shared list, not a comment, is
// why the two planes cannot disagree about which surfaces a committed fact

/** Patch the mainline reply-PREVIEW tail for `rootId` from the reply frame
 *  itself (#task:1745), the companion to {@link mergeMainlineReplyCount} on the
 *  patched-reply path where the window is deliberately not refetched.
 *
 *  ── What "no key for this root" means, per page ────────────────────────────
 *  A page that carries `reply_previews_by_root` AT ALL comes from a preview-
 *  projecting read model, and that read model COMPUTES the sidecar over the
 *  page's complete eligible root set (every non-system top-level message, not
 *  just the ones with replies) and simply OMITS the key for a root whose tail is
 *  empty. So on such a page a missing key is not "unknown": it is the
 *  authoritative statement "this root had no eligible reply when the window was
 *  fetched", and this frame's reply is therefore the tail's first row (Cindy,
 *  #task:1745 BLOCKER 1 — the common 0→1 reply would otherwise only move the
 *  badge). The two genuinely unknown cases stay untouched, both cache-only,
 *  neither fixable by a refetch: a page from a read model that does not project
 *  previews at all (no `reply_previews_by_root` object → nothing to display, so
 *  today's
 *  badge-only row is correct), and a root that is on no loaded page. That is
 *  why this stays a pure cache patch and never falls back to the invalidate
 *  #task:1277 removed: reintroducing it here would refetch the whole window on
 *  every first reply — and on EVERY reply against a non-projecting read model —
 *  which is exactly the amplification that change killed.
 *
 *  Eligibility is mirrored, not re-derived: a system reply is skipped (as in
 *  `reply_counts_by_root`), and a root is seeded only when the page displays it
 *  as a non-system top-level message — the read model's own filter, so an
 *  ineligible root can never grow a tail here that a fetch would then remove.
 *
 *  Replay-safe and BOUNDED: the tail is converged on every write
 *  ({@link convergeReplyPreviewTail}) — one row per `message_id`, seq-ordered,
 *  tail-3 — so replay, an out-of-order frame, and a long burst all land the same
 *  three rows an authoritative fetch would.
 *
 *  Returns `true` when the root's displayed tail is current after this call,
 *  `false` when this root displays no tail at all (ineligible reply, absent
 *  projection, or off-window root) — in every `false` case there is nothing the
 *  caller could recover, so it is a no-op, not a fallback trigger. */
