// Viewer-local projection removal contract at CHANNEL scope (#task:1689).
//
// BUG CLASS this closes: "a third party removed the viewer from channel X" is a
// §12 visibility-loss domain fact with the same fan-out problem the workspace
// arm already solved (#task:1411/#task:1412) — one fact, many independent
// viewer-local React-Query caches, and a hand-maintained cleanup list whose
// omissions are SILENT. Until now the renderer had NO channel-level convergence
// at all: self-leave settled its own caches inside the mutation's `onSuccess`,
// so a removal performed by someone else left the message window, roster,
// attention preference, unread badge, Saved rows, task rows and Activity rows of
// a channel the viewer can no longer see sitting in the cache until an unrelated
// refetch.
//
// The workspace file (`features/workspaces/viewer-removal-contract.ts`) is the
// template; the two differences are deliberate:
//
//   * SCOPE KEY. Layer 1 sweeps by the id in key position 1 (`['channels', cid,
//     …]`, `['conversations', cid, …]`, `['conversation', cid, …]`,
//     `['conversation-members', cid]`, `['channel-detail', cid]`). Matching the
//     POSITION, not an allow-list of roots, is what makes this
//     form-by-construction: a channel-keyed cache added under a new root prefix
//     tomorrow is covered the moment it exists. Ids are unique, so position 1
//     cannot collide across families.
//
//   * MODE decides NAVIGATION and, within the channel-keyed layer, DISCARD vs
//     RE-READ — never WHICH caches are covered. A private channel drops out of
//     discovery entirely (visibility loss) and its caches are destroyed; a public
//     one stays readable with `is_member: false` (membership loss), so the SAME
//     predicate covers it but is graded by the ACTIVITY axis — what the viewer is
//     looking at is revalidated in place, everything unobserved is dropped. The
//     viewer is still on that pane, and emptying it reads as a full reload (shiki
//     2026-07-28). Neither mode consults a hand-maintained list of "which
//     channel-keyed slices are member-only" (thread-followers / threads-list /
//     attachments / run-states …), the exact drift-prone inventory this contract
//     exists to abolish: the member-only ones are gated off for a non-member, so
//     they are the unobserved ones and get dropped without being named.
//
// WHAT A CLEANUP MUST PRODUCE (the rule every registry entry below is judged by):
// the cache as a REFETCH would return it. That is what decides patch vs discard
// vs retain per read model — a list the server membership-filters is patched to
// the filtered shape; a ranked/capped payload or a single-object read the server
// would refuse is discarded; and a read model the server does NOT filter by
// membership is RETAINED, because deleting rows there would diverge from the
// server and be resurrected on the next refetch (see `notifications` in the
// classification below).

/**
 * Settle EVERY viewer-local projection of ONE channel the viewer stopped being a

 *
 * Layer 1: one predicate sweep over every channel-keyed cache (by form, no
 * enumeration), DISCARD or RE-READ per `mode` (below). Layer 2: dispatch each
 * registered payload-attributed read model by `form`, with an exhaustive `never`
 * so a new form cannot skip a branch — mode-independent, because those read
 * models are membership-filtered by the server in BOTH modes, so a row of this
 * channel is a row no refetch would return. The workspace channel list /
 * archived list are NOT touched here: they are refetch-authoritative and are in
 * fact what DETECTS this fact ({@link resolveChannelMembershipLosses}).
 *
 * LAYER 1 FORKS ON `mode`, and the fork is the whole point (shiki 2026-07-28:
 * leaving a public channel "整个会话 UI 会刷新一次"). ONE predicate throughout —
 * the fork is DISCARD vs RE-READ, and for `membership-loss` it is graded by the
 * cache's ACTIVITY AXIS, never by a keep-list of "which slices are member-only"
 * (that inventory is what this contract exists to abolish; an omission in it is
 * silent):
 *   - `visibility-loss` → `removeQueries({ predicate })`. The channel is gone from
 *     discovery and the pane is navigated away, so nothing on screen loses its
 *     data; a private channel must not stay resolvable on any read path (§12 read
 *     authority).
 *   - `membership-loss` → the same predicate, split in two:
 *     `invalidateQueries({ predicate, type: 'active' })` keeps the data of what
 *     the viewer is LOOKING AT and revalidates it in the background — destroying
 *     the mainline window / cluster windows / detail would be a visible reload of
 *     that pane (and would drop the loaded pagination) in exchange for nothing,
 *     since those reads are public-aware and return the same rows;
 *     `removeQueries({ predicate, type: 'inactive' })` drops everything nobody is
 *     observing, so no member-only slice (roster, agents/run-state, threads /
 *     attachments panels, per-viewer unread) survives as cached data.
 *
 * WHY THE SPLIT IS SOUND AND NOT A DISGUISED KEEP-LIST: for a non-member every
 * member-only hook is `enabled`-gated off by `gate.allowMemberEffects`, so at the
 * moment this sweep runs those queries have no enabled observer — they are
 * `inactive` and land in the `remove` arm; what stays `active` is precisely what a
 * non-member still renders. The order matters and it is the caller's: both removal
 * triggers run this from an EFFECT, i.e. after the commit in which the membership
 * carrier already flipped to `is_member: false`, so the activity axis read here is
 * the post-flip one (`Query.isActive()` is `observers.some(o => o.options.enabled
 * !== false)`, and v5 pushes new observer options during render). Calling this
 * from a mutation's `onSuccess` in the same tick as the flip would read the
 * PRE-flip observer set and send a member-only request that is bound to 403.
 *
 * NAMED RESIDUAL (bounded, deliberately not engineered around): a channel of a
 * NON-selected workspace shown in the side pane is reconciled from a WS frame
 * rather than from a commit, so a member-only query of it can still be active for
 * one tick and take a single 403 before its gate closes. It keeps its previous
 * `data` in an error state, renders nothing (the gate is already shut), and is
 * collected on unmount. The alternative — a global "403 ⇒ drop the query" rule —
 * was rejected: it would paper over gate-wiring defects with a cross-layer
 * side effect (@Cindy / @Alice, 2026-07-28).
 *
 * Idempotent: every cleanup is present-only, so a repeat call writes nothing.

/**
 * Which channels of ONE workspace the viewer still holds cleanable state for.
 *
 * This is the gate of the NON-SELECTED workspace path (#task:1689 blocker 2): a
 * §12 domain fact must not wait for navigation, but a workspace the viewer is not
 * looking at has no mounted channel lists, so there is no "previously observed
 * member set" to diff. The answer is the other direction — the caches themselves
 * say which channels they still describe, and only those are worth an
 * authoritative re-read.
 *
 * TWO sources, because the two layers carry attribution differently:
 *   - payload-attributed read models answer for themselves (their rows carry
 *     `workspace_id`);
 *   - layer-1 CHANNEL-KEYED caches carry no workspace anywhere, so they are
 *     attributed through the immutable identity index
 *     ({@link channelWorkspaceOf}). Leaving them out — as the first cut did, on
 *     the theory that channel-keyed caches belong to the workspace the viewer has
 *     open — was wrong twice over: React Query keeps `['channels', cid, …]`,
 *     `['conversation-members', cid]`, `['channel-detail', cid]` and run states
 *     after the viewer walks B → A, and a workspace holding ONLY those would fail
 *     the `observed.length > 0` gate and never even be re-read. Coming back to B
 *     could not repair it either: the first converged tick there only establishes
 *     a baseline, and the removed channel is in neither list to be diffed.

 *
 * §12.1#9 RESIDUAL: a channel-keyed cache for a channel this client has never

 * renderer has TODAY states the workspace — the selected workspace's two lists,
 * channel-detail, the cross-workspace archived index, the one shared
 * conversation-ref read point (`?side` panes and inline `#conv:` chips), and a
 * notification's own `(workspace_id, conversation_id)` pair — and the two
 * carrier-side enumerations in `channel-workspace-index.ts` are what keep a new
 * ref producer from landing without the write-through. A REFUSED carrier leaves
 * nothing behind either: a `?side` ref that 403s resolves to `unauthorized`, and
 * that descriptor renders `SideUnresolvedPlaceholder` instead of mounting
 * `ChannelView`, so the path that cannot learn the workspace is the same path
 * that writes no channel-keyed cache. What remains open is a FUTURE carrier of a
 * different shape that yields a bare channel id: that is the named gap,
 * deliberately not covered by a second store — an unattributed cache is skipped
 * and expires by gc, and a CONFLICTING attribution is dropped outright rather
