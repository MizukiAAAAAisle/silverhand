 * is a duplicate (`seq <= received`) OR falls in the active replay window
 * (`seq <= backfillThrough`, same epoch); otherwise `live`. See

 *   frame. Serves wire-continuity / forward-gap detection ONLY, and derives
 *   delivery provenance (a frame at-or-below it is a `backfill` re-delivery). It
 *   is NOT a resume floor.
 * - `appliedPositions[scope]` — the resume FLOOR (what `resume` replays from).
 *   For a CONTENT-GATED scope (`conversation:<id>`, the message stream) it is
 *   advanced ONLY by `markSatisfied` (a resume-safe disposition) or `commitSnapshotBaseline`
 *   (an apply-settled snapshot re-cold-start) — never by frame receipt. For every
 *   OTHER scope (viewer / workspace / app / `conversation-side:`) there is no
 *   content-apply seam, so the floor auto-advances with `received` (the pre-P2
 *   single-cursor behavior, preserved bit-for-bit).
 *
 * The two coincide for auto-advance scopes and while a content reader applies
 * every frame; they diverge when a content-gated scope receives a frame that
 * writes no warm content (no reader / off-window no-op) — `received` advances so
 * the stream keeps flowing and gaps stay detectable, `applied` stays pinned so a
 * resume re-delivers the un-applied frame (idempotent) rather than skipping it
 * (the #1251 class of bug). See docs/event-ws-transport-v1.md §1/§4.1/§5/§6.

   * committed the frame's effect OR been forced through an authoritative fetch
   * (no warm displayable cache left). The ingestor computes that disposition

   *
   * The advance is a PENDING-SATISFACTION QUEUE (#1261 — the option-2 this note

   * contiguously from `floor+1` through every already-satisfied seq. An

   *
   * Two invariants are load-bearing and MUST NOT be relaxed:
   *  - NEVER ESTABLISHES a floor. A satisfied seq with no same-epoch floor
   *    (missing / stale-epoch) is dropped with a diagnostic; only the
   *    `subscribed` ack and `commitSnapshotBaseline` may establish one (they
   *    reflect the server head). Establishing here from an arbitrary satisfied
   *    seq would let the next resume start above un-received seqs, silently
   *    skipping them (the #1251 skip-unseen hole). The floor self-heals when the
   *    next ack / snapshot baselines it.
   *  - COMMIT-GATED, not dispatch-gated (initiated ≠ committed). The caller must
   *    have COMMITTED every effect before calling; this method trusts that and
   *    only sequences the floor. A seq at-or-below the floor is an idempotent
   *    no-op (a replay re-satisfy).

   * frame should be dispatched, and — when it should — whether it is `live` or
   * `backfill`.
   *
   * The bug this guards against: a frame dropped while the socket stays OPEN
   * (so resume-on-reconnect never fires) used to advance the cursor silently,
   * stranding the UI one-or-more events behind until a manual refresh. We detect
   * the forward gap on the received-water and trigger a resume FROM THE APPLIED
   * FLOOR so the server replays the hole in order (and re-delivers any
   * un-applied content below the received-water too — §4.1).
   *
   * Cases (same epoch as the received-water):
   * - `seq === received + 1` — contiguous. Advance received (and, for a
   *   non-content-gated scope, the auto floor), drop any recovery latch. Provenance
   *   is `backfill` iff the frame falls in the active replay window
   *   (`seq <= backfillThrough`, same epoch) — a replay-drain frame FILLING a seq
   *   we never received (a forward-gap fill, a new-during-disconnect frame) — else
   *   `live` (fresh fanout past the window).
   * - `seq > received + 1` — forward gap. Hold received, RAISE the replay window
   *   to this seq (every swallowed gapped frame extends it, so all of them tag
   *   `backfill` on replay — not just the first), resume from the applied floor,
   *   latch `recovering` so the resume + diagnostic coalesce, swallow the frame
   *   (replay redelivers it).
   * - `seq <= received` — a duplicate re-delivery by definition (already observed).
   *   Dispatch as `backfill` without moving any water mark or disturbing recovery.
   *
   * Provenance is NOT derived from the received-water alone — `seq <= received`
   * only catches DUPLICATE re-delivery, never a replay frame filling a
   * never-received seq (which is `> received`). Those need the replay window
   * (`backfillThrough`, armed by the resubscribe ack / gap), so a non-idempotent
   * delta takes authoritative recovery rather than a blind `+1` (a concurrent REST
   * snapshot may already cover it). A missing received-water or an epoch change is
   * a fresh baseline (`live`) rather than a gap.
