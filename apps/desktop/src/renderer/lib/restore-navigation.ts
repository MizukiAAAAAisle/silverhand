/**
 * Route-restore precedence (#task:1300, extracted from App's auto-select
 * effect).
 *
 * When the chat route resolves to a workspace with NO channel selected
 * (bare `/chat/w/:id`, or after a clear), one of several signals decides
 * which channel to open. The precedence — locked across #task:1082 /
 * #task:1145 and mirrored from the original inline effect — is:
 *
 *   1. **honored jump** — a pending {@link MessageJumpTarget} names a channel
 *      that exists in this workspace: go there (Saved → jump must not snap
 *      back to the remembered/default channel). A jump is an EXPLICIT user
 *      intent, so it is the ONE path allowed to land on an archived channel.
 *   2. **remembered channel** — the per-workspace last-viewed channel, unless
 *      it's the just-archived primary (`excludeId`), gone, or now ARCHIVED (an
 *      archived last-viewed channel must never be auto-restored — #task:1413).
 *      Its secondary-pane intent is resolved by {@link resolveChannelOpen}: a
 *      fresh unread thread (past the close-watermark) surfaces that thread,
 *      otherwise the remembered layout is restored.
 *   3. **default fallback** — the first active top-level channel, excluding a
 *      just-archived primary still lingering in the stale list.
 *   4. **none** — no workspace / a channel is already selected / no channels /
 *      no fallback: do nothing.
 *
 * AUTO entries (remembered + fallback) share ONE active-channel gate
 * (`activeTopLevel`): archived channels are reachable only through the Archived
 * panel or an explicit jump, never restored/defaulted into. Because every auto
 * trigger — workspace switch, reload, route restore — funnels through this one
 * resolver, that single gate keeps them all from drifting to an archived
 * target (#task:1413).
 *
 * This resolver is PURE: it reads no refs, no module singletons, and performs
 * no navigation. The caller reads the current ref / place-memory / unread
 * state, calls this, and executes the returned action. That keeps the
 * load-bearing precedence unit-testable independent of React/nav wiring,
 * while every side effect stays in the effect.
