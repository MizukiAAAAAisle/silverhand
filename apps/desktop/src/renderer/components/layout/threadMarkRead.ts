/**
 * Pure freshness gate for thread mark-read (#task:1226 surface 4, §9).
 *
 * Opening a thread marks its reply-cluster read (read-to-clear), advancing the
 * viewer's per-thread `conversation_reads` cursor to the OPEN-TIME stream head.
 * The hard part is proving the snapshot came from THIS open's window response —
 * not the previous open's cache that React Query serves synchronously on
 * reopen, and not a `setQueryData` mutation (an optimistic live-append) that
 * bumps `dataUpdatedAt` without being a real window read.
 *
 * So the gate keys on `windowFetchSucceededAt` — an epoch stamped ONLY inside
 * the cluster query's success path (unreachable by `setQueryData`) — compared
 * against `openedAt`, captured when the (channel, root) open began. The
 * once-guard (`alreadyMarkedForOpen`) is re-armed per open by the caller, so a
 * stale cache can never lock the guard before a fresh fetch lands.
 *
 * Returns the snapshot seq to mark, or null to wait / skip. Kept pure so the
 * reopen-stale-cache regression is testable without React render timing.

 * in the THREAD stream, whose head (`conversation_stream_heads` keyed on a

 * Taking the max seq of the raw cluster window therefore yields the root's
 * mainline seq on a reply-less thread, and posting that as a thread `at_seq` is
 * a position beyond the thread head — which the backend correctly rejects with
 * `position_future` 400 (observed once in the 2026-08-13 packaged smoke). The
 * fix belongs here, in the cursor's domain, NOT in loosening that validation.
 *
 * A reply-less thread returns null, so the live gate holds and NO observe
 * request is sent. Pending optimistic rows are skipped by `lastCommittedSeq`
