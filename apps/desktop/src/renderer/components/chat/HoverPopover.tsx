/**
 * Hover-triggered popover used by inline reference chips.
 *
 * Opens after a 500ms grace so brief flick-throughs (mouse moving past
 * a paragraph) don't paint a popover at all. After the grace, the
 * caller decides whether to render real content or a skeleton — the
 * caller already owns the data fetch via React Query, so this
 * component is intentionally dumb.
 *
 * Visible-state contract (set by the user, see `mtRX9X1H93dDVDKw`):
 *   - 0–500ms hover  → popover NOT visible. Fetch races in the
 *                       background (callers mount their queries
 *                       eagerly), so by the time the popover opens
 *                       the cache is usually warm.
 *   - ≥ 500ms, data ready → render content directly.
 *   - ≥ 500ms, still loading → render skeleton (NO spinner — that
 *                              was explicitly ruled out in design).
 *
 * `closeDelay={120}` gives the user a brief window to move from chip
 * → popover so the popover doesn't snap shut between them. Defaults
 * here mirror radix recommendations for hover-card "open delay" UX.
