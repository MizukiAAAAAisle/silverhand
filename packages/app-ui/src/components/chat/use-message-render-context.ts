/**
 * Single source of truth for the lookup maps every message-rendering
 * surface needs (channel pane + thread reply-cluster pane). Both
 * `ChannelView`'s `MessageList` and `ThreadPanel` consume this so an
 * inline `@mention` / `#<channel>` / `#conv:` / `#task:` sigil resolves
 * IDENTICALLY no matter which pane renders the message.
 *
 * Previously `MessageList` and `ThreadPanel` each hand-built a slice of
 * this context; ThreadPanel's slice was incomplete (empty
 * `channelsByName`, no `#conv:` refs) which made thread messages render
 * sigils as inert text — the divergence this hook removes (#task:1052).
 *
 * Scope boundary: this hook owns the *identity + sigil-resolution* maps
 * and the per-user avatar batch (`humanAvatarUrls`). It deliberately
 * does NOT build the AGENT avatar batch (`agentAvatarUrls`): that one is
 * lifted by the caller so message authors, the member strip, and the
 * activity bubble share a single batch fetch (Cindy's batching
 * discipline — leaf surfaces must not double-fetch avatar blobs). The
 * caller passes its lifted `agentAvatarUrls` straight to `MessageItem`.
 *
 * The raw `liveChannels` / `archivedChannels` lists are exposed too so
 * non-render consumers (e.g. the export-screenshot channel title) reuse
 * the same already-fetched data instead of refetching.
