/**
 * 4px-wide draggable column divider — the shared paint + geometry for every
 * resizable seam (sidebar↔conversation and activity-list↔channel via
 * `VerticalSplitter`; conversation↔thread/side-pane via `SplitPane`). Owns the
 * track's LOOK and PLACEMENT only; each parent wires its own drag mechanism and
 * passes pointer handlers (+ optionally `active` / a ref) through.
 *
 * PAINT. Transparent by default (`--splitter-bg`, neutral fallback
 * `--border-subtle`); hover or active drag tints with `--splitter-hover-bg` — a
 * neutral ink every theme sets (fence-enforced in appearance.test.ts, since
 * poster declares it). The `var(--border)` fallback is a neutral safety net: a
 * divider is a utility signal, so it must never fall back to `--accent` — a
 * saturated accent on a 4px separator reads as "look at this!" and steals the
 * accent budget (v6.9.6 #task:917: poster's fallback used to map to hot brand
 * pink).
 *
 * GEOMETRY (#task:1965 review round 1). The track is a flex item, so without
 * help it would add its own 4px column ON TOP of the sheet's `--pane-gap`,
 * pushing the panes `gap + 4 + gap` apart. The negative inline margin pulls it
 * back so the VISIBLE distance between panes stays exactly `--pane-gap` with the
 * track centred in it — derived from the gap here (not a per-theme
 * `--splitter-offset` token), so a theme that changes its gap and forgets the
 * offset can't get a silently wrong seam (exactly what happened when iris took
 * the gap to 0). At `--pane-gap: 0` the track straddles the seam (±2px into each
 * pane), which is why it needs `zIndex`: both panes are positioned, so a later
 * sibling would otherwise paint its background over the track's right half. For
 * gapped themes the track sits inside the empty gutter, so the stacking order is
 * a no-op there.
