 *  - `idle` — the route names no pair. Nothing is being awaited.

 *    stays false, so a viewer whose cached list predates the pair (exactly the
 *    acceptance case — a stranger's first DM) would otherwise read as a settled
 *    absence and flash the terminal empty state before the row arrives.
 *  - `absent` — the current authority answered and this viewer is not an
 *    endpoint of that conversation (or it does not exist). TERMINAL, and it gets
 *    its OWN rendering ({@link directPairPaneProps} `notFound`) rather than the
 *    no-selection empty state: a loader here would never end, and "select a
 *    channel" would claim the viewer chose nothing.
 *  - `error` — the read that would answer failed and left no row. Not `absent`
 *    (nothing was proven about the pair) and not `resolving` (nothing is in
 *    flight, and with `retry: 1` the client will not keep trying on its own).
 *
 * Precedence is `ready > resolving > error > absent`: a row we hold is enough to
 * render the pane even while a refetch is in flight, and only a settled,
