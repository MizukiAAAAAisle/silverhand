// Channel → workspace IDENTITY index (#task:1689 blocker 2).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The channel-removal contract has to answer "which channels OF
// WORKSPACE B does this client still hold state for" for a workspace the viewer is
// NOT looking at. Payload-attributed read models answer it themselves (their rows
// carry `workspace_id`), but the layer-1 CHANNEL-KEYED caches — `['channels', cid,
// …]`, `['conversation-members', cid]`, `['channel-detail', cid]`, run states,
// inline-find — carry the channel id in the key and no workspace anywhere. After
// the viewer walks B → A those caches stay in React Query, and without an
// attribution source the foreign-workspace trigger cannot even tell they describe
// B, so a removal there would leave them until garbage collection.
//
// WHY IT IS SOUND. `conversations.workspace_id` is IMMUTABLE: no code path
// UPDATEs it (the only conversation updates are `archived_at`, `title`,
// `visibility`, `closed_at/status`) — a channel is never moved between
// workspaces. So a binding learned once is a permanent identity fact, and reading
// it back later cannot be stale in the way a cached LIST can.
//
// WHAT IT MUST NEVER DO. Answer visibility or membership. This index says only
// "channel X belongs to workspace W". Whether the viewer may still see X is
// decided exclusively by a fresh authoritative read. Keeping those two questions
// apart is what makes an old entry harmless.
//
// WRITE-THROUGH, never a second authority: every writer records the binding at
// the moment a DTO that carries it lands, so the index cannot disagree with the
// DTO it was derived from.
//
// IS AN UNATTRIBUTED CHANNEL-KEYED CACHE REACHABLE IN PRODUCTION? That is the
// question that decides whether a persistent index is needed. Every channel id
// the renderer can hand to a channel-keyed read arrives through one of the
// carriers in {@link CHANNEL_WORKSPACE_ATTRIBUTION_SOURCES}, each of which
// states the workspace: the primary pane resolves its carrier out of the
// selected workspace's two lists (or, when the id is in neither, out of
// channel-detail); the `?side` pane and every inline `#conv:<id>` chip resolve
// theirs through the ONE shared conversation-ref read point; and a notification
// jump records the pair the notification itself carries, which is what covers
// the reply-cluster branch that returns without fetching a ref at all.
//
// WHAT PINS THAT, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE. Two mechanical checks, both
// enumerated from the CARRIER side rather than from the recording side (a list
// drawn from the modules that already record can only ever confirm itself):
// `apiPaths.conversationRef` may appear in exactly one non-test module — the
// shared read point — and no other module may fetch the `['conversation-ref',
// …]` key (invalidate/remove only). Deleting a write-through, or adding a second
// ref producer without one, goes red. What they do NOT prove is that some future
// carrier of a different shape states a workspace at all; that residual is named
// below.
//
// A REFUSED ref is not a hole either: a 403 resolves to `unauthorized`, which
// renders the unresolved placeholder rather than mounting `ChannelView`, so the
// one path that cannot learn the workspace is also a path that writes no
// channel-keyed cache.
//
// §12.1#9 RESIDUAL: a FUTURE carrier that yields a bare channel id with no
// workspace anywhere (a new endpoint, a deep link parsed straight into a
// channel-keyed read). Its caches would be attributed to no workspace, so the
// foreign-workspace probe would skip them and they would expire by gc instead of
// being swept. The fail-safe direction — the index never guesses a workspace,
// and drops a binding entirely when two carriers disagree — is what keeps that
// residual harmless.
