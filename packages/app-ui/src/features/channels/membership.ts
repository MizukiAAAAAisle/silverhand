/**
 * Per-viewer channel membership: the single source deciding what a viewer may
 * do in a channel. A public channel is readable by a workspace user who is NOT
 * a member of it (browse-and-Join), so membership is a THREE-state axis, never
 * a boolean:
 *
 *   - `member`    — the viewer belongs; full member behavior.
 *   - `nonmember` — a public channel the viewer can browse but hasn't joined;
 *                   read-only allowlist + a Join affordance.
 *   - `unknown`   — the authoritative signal hasn't resolved yet (a deep-link /
 *                   detail path whose carrier lacks `is_member`).
 *
 * The gate is FAIL-CLOSED: `unknown` is treated like `nonmember` for every
 * member effect / mutation / write affordance. Defaulting to member would leak
 * an auto mark-read/observe or expose a write control in the window before the
 * authoritative state lands. Only a resolved `member` unlocks member behavior.
 *
 * Authority rule (locked): membership is read ONLY from
 * the `is_member` boolean the carrier itself provides (a discovery-union list
 * item, or a channel-detail response). It is NEVER inferred from anything
 * outside the field — not its placement/roster axes, not its presence in a list —
 * because any such second predicate re-introduces a fail-open path the moment a
 * payload lacks the field. The discovery union also mixes joined and unjoined
 * public channels in one list, so list position proves nothing. A carrier that
 * lacks the field is `unknown` → fetch detail. (DM items therefore rely on the
 * backend stamping `is_member: true`; there is no `dm_channel ⇒ member`
 * shortcut here.)
