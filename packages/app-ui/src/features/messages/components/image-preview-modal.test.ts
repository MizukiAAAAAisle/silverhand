/**
 * The image export freezes each `#task:<n>`'s CURRENT resolved title into the
 * static screenshot. The title must come from the SAME by-number cache cell the
 * live chip resolved — projected from the conversation's placement, not from
 * whatever coordinate happens to be non-null. A wrong scope is a SILENT failure:
 * it reads an empty cell and every task ref exports as a bare number, which no
 * pixel/render test on `MessageScreenshotView` would catch (that only tests how
 * a given title draws). So the scope decision is pinned here on the pure seam.
