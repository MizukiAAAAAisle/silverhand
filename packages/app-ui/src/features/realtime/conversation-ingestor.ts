/**
 * Stage-2 central conversation ingestor (#task:1255).
 *
 * The single App-level consumer of conversation realtime frames across BOTH
 * transport scopes — the message stream `conversation:<id>` (message /
 * message_reaction_changed / task_changed) and the side channel
 * `conversation-side:<id>` (agent_status / agent_activity /
 * conversation_activity). It owns the cache writes that used to
 * live in each view's `onWsFrame` handler, so views can be
 * pure readers (zero `onWsFrame`) — the precondition Stage-2 P2 needs to drop the
 * orphan gate (gate-(b)). See docs/renderer-event-ingestion-v1.md and
 * docs/event-ws-transport-v1.md §4.2.
 *
 * P1a + P1b + P1c scope: the main-stream caches (old
 * `useChannelMessages.onEvent`), the thread cluster / root / followers caches
 * (old `useThreadCluster` / `useThreadRoot` / `useThreadFollowers` `onEvent`s),
 * the channel Threads list (old `useChannelThreads.onEvent`), `agent_activity`
 * + run-states reconcile (old `useAgentRunStates.onEvent` + the shared bridge
 * side-effect), `agent_status` (old `useChannelAgents.onEvent`), and
 * `conversation_activity` (old `AgentActivityTimeline.onEvent`). The message-
 * window and product-projection caches are all driven HERE; the one exception is
 * `useConversationMembers` — a side-scope, invalidate-only consumer that keeps
 * its own `onWsFrame` (cursor-inert: no message-window cache, just a members
 * refetch on `conversation_members_changed`). `ChannelView`'s
 * read cursor is NOT here by design — read advancement stays on the read axis
 * (`useMarkMessageChannelRead`), driven by the mainline cache, not frame arrival
 * (read-inert, #1244/#1251).
 *
 * SCOPE PARTITION (#task:1255 P2 step-3). The recovery classes are split across
 * two disjoint transport scopes. Routing goes through the SHARED parsers only
 * (`parseConversationScope` / `parseConversationSideScope`) — never a fuzzy
 * `startsWith('conversation')` — so a side frame never reaches a message-stream
 * apply and vice-versa. Side kinds publish to `conversation-side:<id>` (backend
 * cutover = Alice P2 step-2); a `snapshot_required` reconciles only the caches of
 * the scope it arrived on. The message-derived Threads list / thread followers
 * STAY on the message stream (their liveness rides the `message` kind).
 *
 * PER-TARGET READER GATE (behavior equivalence — P1 = prep, not correctness):
 * each write ran in the old code ONLY while its hook was mounted. The ingestor
 * preserves that — mainline writes gate on {@link hasActiveMainlineReader};
 * cluster / root / follower writes enumerate the OPEN reader roots (those with a
 * live observer) and apply per-root. A scope kept subscribed by INTEREST alone
 * (e.g. an Activity ThreadPanel-only pane: thread reader, no mainline reader)
 * must NOT bootstrap/patch a target with no REST snapshot behind it — a blanket
 * gate would mis-fire (Cindy blocker #1 / its cluster-axis dual, Alice).
 *
 * These reader gates govern where CONTENT is WRITTEN — they are NOT lifted by P2
 * / #1261 (P3's interest-registry adds cold-start seeding so a readerless scope
 * can hold content at all). P2 splits the single cursor into two water-marks: a
 * `received-water` (wire continuity / gap detection, always advances on arrival)
 * ⊥ an `applied-water` (the resume floor). #1261 promotes the applied-water from
 * "content-apply only" to SATISFACTION: the floor advances once EVERY per-frame
 * effect is settled-fulfilled — a synchronous content apply (in-window append /
 * cluster append·patch / reaction·task chip patch / live-gap affordance), an
 * AUTHORITATIVE derived-invalidate that COMMITS (reply count #1263 (c) /
 * followers / threads list — an invalidate INITIATES recovery, so the floor waits
 * for its refetch, initiated ≠ committed), or a warm-inactive window REMOVED so it
 * cold-starts. A rejected refetch pins the floor (the transport re-drives on the
 * next resume). This REFINES the old orphan-gate floor-pin rather than preserving
 * it: a frame with no active reader and NO warm cache is COLD-ABSENT → its effect
 * set is empty → vacuously satisfied (the floor advances), because its content
 * cold-starts authoritatively on next open and advancing past it can't strand a
 * warm cache — the #1251 hole needs a warm DISPLAYABLE cache, which cold-absent
 * lacks. A readerless-but-WARM window is instead removed (never vacuously
 * satisfied — that would serve post-advance stale rows, Cindy B1). So the reader
 * gate governs cache-writes, not the floor. (`reaction` is the one carve-out —
 * a pure idempotent by-id patch with no derived-invalidate, so it keeps the
 * synchronous content-apply gate. `task_changed` is also a by-id patch but writes
 * its ABSOLUTE chip snapshot to active AND warm-inactive caches and then always
 * satisfies for a source-backed frame — displayed/warm patched, off-window
 * vacuous-satisfy — so it leaves no stale warm cache and never pins the floor on
 * an out-of-window source row.) The `markSatisfied` / `commitSnapshotBaseline` water-
 * mark WRITERS live in Alice's transport seam (`ws-client.ts`, step-4); this
 * ingestor is their sole content-driven CALLER — it fires `markSatisfied` off the
 * per-frame `Promise.allSettled` satisfaction join and drives
 * `commitSnapshotBaseline` off the snapshot-reconcile settle join (see
 * `ingestConversationFrame` below). See §3.1/§5.
 *
 * Read-inert by construction: it never advances the viewer read cursor or
 * writes notification read state — read advancement stays visibility/intent-
 * driven (#task:1244, #task:1251). The applied-water it drives here is the
 * transport RESUME floor, a distinct axis from the viewer read cursor; the
 * `received-water` still auto-advances transport-side (`acceptEventFrame`).
 */

// Scope routing goes through the SHARED parsers only (never a fuzzy
// `startsWith('conversation')`, which would let a `conversation-side:` frame
// leak into the message-stream branch). `parseConversationScope` matches
// `conversation:<id>` (message stream: message / message_reaction_changed /
// task_changed);
// `parseConversationSideScope` matches `conversation-side:<id>` (side channel:
// agent_status / agent_activity / conversation_activity). The two prefixes are
// disjoint by construction (#task:1255 P2 step-3).

/** Build the SATISFACTION disposition for one committed-message payload
 *  (#task:1255 / #task:1263 (c)). Returns the per-effect settle Promises the
 *  caller joins with `Promise.allSettled` to gate `markSatisfied` — all-fulfilled
 *  advances the resume floor once; a rejected refetch pins it (§4.1 / #1261,
 *  commit-gated ≠ dispatch-gated). This is the per-event twin of
 *  {@link ingestMessageStreamSnapshotRequired}: an active reader APPLIES content
 *  (append/gap → resolved) or RECOVERS a derived projection (reply count /
 *  followers / threads list → the invalidate's settle); a warm-but-inactive
 *  CONTENT window is REMOVED, never left to serve post-advance stale rows (Cindy
 *  B1 / #1255 §6); a cold ABSENT target contributes nothing → the frame is
 *  vacuously satisfied (its content cold-starts authoritatively on next open, so
 *  advancing the floor past it can't strand a warm cache — the #1251 hole needs a
 *  warm displayable cache, which cold-absent lacks). Unlike the snapshot handler's
 *  blanket sweep, a live frame touches only its OWN root, so the warm-cluster
 *  removal is SCOPED to that root.
 *
 *  RAW effects only — NEVER call this from two planes directly. Both the WS frame
 *  and the human send ACK are authoritative inputs for the SAME committed message,
 *  so they enter through {@link applyCommittedMessage}, which batches these writes
 *  for atomic observer visibility (count + preview tail + threads-list land in one
 *  notification). Data correctness does NOT depend on running exactly once: every
 *  write here is by-id/absolute (append short-circuits on `cacheHasMessage`, counts
 *  SET an absolute value, previews dedupe by message_id, threads-list overwrites by
 *  root) or an idempotent invalidate. So when the ACK and the WS frame both deliver
 *  this committed message, re-running is safe — the only cost is that the
 *  invalidate-only effects (followers / attachments / no-projection fallback) MAY
 *  refetch once more. That duplicate is deliberately accepted (Cindy + shiki,
 *  #task:1749): a message-level coordination receipt to erase it would trade real
 *  state complexity (per-scope retention aligned to the replay horizon, in-flight
 *  pinning, compare-and-delete release) for a bounded best-effort refetch. If
 *  telemetry ever proves a material amplification, upgrade the specific projection
 *  to an absolute patch or add generic coalescing at the query layer instead of a
 *  message-level receipt. This function itself writes NO transport water —
 *  `markSatisfied` is the WS wrapper's exclusive job (#task:1749). */
