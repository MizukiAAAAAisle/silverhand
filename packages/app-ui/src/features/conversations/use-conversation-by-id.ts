 *
 * Precedence, given that `isError` and `data` are NOT mutually exclusive (both
 * shapes below were measured on a real `QueryObserver`, @Cindy #task:2038):
 *   1. 403 / 404 are AUTHORITATIVE ANSWERS about the id and stay terminal even
 *      with a retained ref — the conversation is gone, or refused. The asymmetry
 *      is the point (@Alice): a 403/404 is a STATEMENT about this id and may
 *      overturn what we hold; a 5xx / transport failure states nothing and may
 *      not.
 *   2. Otherwise a held successful ref WINS over a refetch that is in flight or
 *      that settled in failure. A single 500 / dropped socket must not flip an
 *      already-labelled chip or an open `?side` pane from its real title to an
 *      error placeholder. This is the same rule the pair face applies to a held
 *      row in `conversation-identity.ts`; the two faces may not disagree on it.
 *   3. With no ref in hand, `isError` IS the settled signal, with no in-flight
 *      criterion needed: React Query resets a data-less query to `pending` for
 *      each new attempt, so `isError && !data` never means "an attempt is
 *      running". The bounded retry budget (`failureCount < 2`) is therefore
 *      spent — terminal `unresolved`, because a spent budget rendered as
 *      `loading` is a skeleton that never ends (@Cindy, #task:2038 B1).
 *
 * WHY NO `isFetching` HERE, and what would license bringing it back. The rule it
 * would serve (@Alice) is: an in-flight criterion may only DELAY a verdict while
 * a request is genuinely in flight, never turn a settled failure into a
 * non-failure. Under measured semantics that rule has no work to do in case 3 —
 * the state it would fire on does not occur — so the branch would be unreachable
 * code. `use-conversation-by-id.test.ts` measures that reachability against the
 * production options, so if React Query ever retains `error` across a data-less
 * refetch (or `placeholderData` lands here, making `data` present with no
 * successful read behind it), that test goes red instead of this file quietly
 * reporting `unresolved` about a request that is still running.

 * Status mapping (see `mapConversationByIdResult`):
 *   - `loading`      → React Query is still fetching (initial load, or a
 *                       non-403/404 failure being retried) OR `id === null`.
 *   - `resolved`     → 200, `ref` populated — including a ref still in hand
 *                       while a later refetch is in flight or has failed.
 *   - `not_found`    → 404 from the backend. For a WORKSPACE-placed id that
 *                       means gone; for a `direct_pair` it is the correct
 *                       answer of an arm that cannot express one, which is why
 *                       this face is composed with the pair list rather than
 *                       read alone (`useConversationIdentity`, #task:2038).
 *   - `unauthorized` → 403 from the backend (caller can't see this
 *                       workspace). v1 user permission model never
 *                       returns 403, but we map it here so the
 *                       backend stays the source of truth.
 *   - `unresolved`   → the read settled in failure with the retry budget spent
 *                       AND no ref in hand. Nothing was proven; consumers that
 *                       gate on `resolved` stay fail-closed by construction.
