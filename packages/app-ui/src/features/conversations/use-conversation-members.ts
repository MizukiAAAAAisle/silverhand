 *
 * The backend route is the single source of truth shared with the
 * platform prompt's "Channel members:" block — divergence
 * between what the agent talks about and what the chip strip shows is
 * structurally impossible.
 *
 * Self filtering is the caller's job: the renderer drops the current
 * human viewer (UI-self) by `kind === 'human' && user_id === viewer.id`.
 * This hook does not filter — it returns the full list so other
 * surfaces (popovers, "+N more" overlays) can render every member.
 *
 * Realtime invalidation: subscribes to the side-channel scope
 * `conversation-side:{id}` (#task:1255 P2 step-3 — `conversation_members_changed`
 * is a side kind) and invalidates the cache on `conversation_members_changed`.
 * This means
 * the renderer reseats the strip when a member is added by ANY route
 * — the local renderer mutation, an agent's `silverhand member add`,
 * or another window doing the same. `snapshot_required` for the same
 * scope also triggers a refetch (epoch mismatch / replay gap).
