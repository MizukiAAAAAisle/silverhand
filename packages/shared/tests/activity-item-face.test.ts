/**
 * The Activity face answers row-1 identity by PLACEMENT and never by roster
 * (#task:2076, extended by #task:2115).
 *
 * WHY THIS NEEDS A CELL. The mis-keying it forbids is not a wrong branch, it is a
 * FIELD: while `ActivityItemDto` carried `conversation_roster_policy` — with a
 * docblock instructing the renderer to derive a "Channel / DM" label from it — the
 * only way to draw the row-1 glyph was to classify the conversation by its roster,
 * so an agent home's DM channel and its Onboarding channel (workspace-placed,
 * fixed roster) were drawn as private lines. Removing the field is what makes the
 * wrong glyph unrepresentable; this cell is what stops it from coming back, in
 * either spelling.
 *
 * WHAT #task:2115 CHANGED, AND WHAT IT DID NOT. Activity now admits BOTH placements
 * (a workspace-less `direct_pair`'s unread enters the global list), so the face does
 * carry a placement discriminant today — inside `location`, where it is a live
 * two-arm branch rather than the constant `'workspace'` a top-level
 * `conversation_placement_kind` would have been before. The rule is untouched:
 * identity is placement's question, roster's live role for Activity stays
 * SERVER-SIDE (the §5.1 salience grade — a fixed-roster stream's ambient unread is
 * directed-grade — decided in `read-model/activity.ts` off the SQL row), and a
 * fixed-roster channel inside an agent home is still a channel.
 *
 * The keying rule itself is written once, on
 * {@link ConversationPlacementKindSchema}; this file is its enforcement for one
 * face. The route-level counterpart (`backend/tests/routes/activity.test.ts`)
 * asserts the absence on a PARSED HTTP BODY and fails differently: nothing
 * re-validates the response against this schema on the way out, so that cell
 * catches EMITTING a forbidden field while this one catches DECLARING it.
