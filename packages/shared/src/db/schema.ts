// Reasoning effort is a bounded, opaque, lowercase TOKEN — one shape shared by
// persistence, the HTTP DTOs, and the daemon `runtime_start` wire. It has NO
// global legality semantics: this schema only bounds the STRUCTURE (charset +
// length), it is NOT a registry of which values are legal. Reasoning effort has
// no cross-vendor standard, so the value namespace belongs to each runtime — the
// SOLE allowlist of which tokens a given runtime/model pair accepts lives in the
// runtime catalog (`reasoningEffortValidForRuntime` /
// `reasoningEffortOptionsByModel`), never in a global enum.
//
// Two consequences of the bound:
//   - it stops a malformed value from reaching a CLI as a config override;
//   - any NEW daemon that adopts this open-token schema can FRAME a token it has
//     never heard of rather than strict-reject the whole `runtime_start`, so
//     adding a new effort value never requires a wire-protocol bump — the
//     receiver-future-compat half of the two-layer capability model (#task:1486).
//     An OLD daemon still on a closed enum would strict-reject an unknown token;
//     it is protected NOT by this schema but by the send gate — the backend only
//     sends a non-baseline token to a daemon advertising the
//     `runtime.codex.reasoning.v1` capability, so a strict old daemon never
//     receives one. (That daemon capability protects backend→daemon only; it does
//     NOT make an old backend→desktop DTO reader understand a future token.)

/**
 * WHERE a conversation lives, and therefore how its participant set is derived
 * (agent-scoped-session-v1 §3/§4.1). Exhaustive and mutually exclusive:
 * `workspace` keeps explicit membership rows; `direct_pair` derives its
 * participants from the placement itself. Migration v69 introduces the axis with
 * only `workspace` representable — the placement-specific columns arrive with the
 * placements themselves (§8 P0-b / P3).
 *
 * There were three placements until #task:2072: `agent_inbox` was a
 * single-participant container minted one per agent, and it is retired (v84/v85)
 * because waking an agent must happen in a conversation that has a SECOND
 * participant. Every placement here now has at least two.
 *
 * THE KEYING RULE, stated here ONCE because three read points got it wrong
 * independently (#task:2074 / #task:2076 / #task:2077, all one mis-keying):
 * a conversation's IDENTITY — what it IS, what it is called, which glyph names it
 * — is a function of PLACEMENT. Its CAPABILITIES — may members be added, may the
 * roster change, does unread arrive directed-grade — are a function of
 * `roster_policy`. Every read point must say which of the two it is asking, and a
 * `roster_policy` read may never stand in for the identity question: a fixed
 * roster is a CONSEQUENCE of some placements, never the definition of one (an
 * agent home's DM channel and its Onboarding channel are workspace-placed with a
 * fixed roster, and #task:1373 says a workspace conversation is a channel
 * whatever its roster).
 *
 * The corollary that keeps costing a wire field: a read face RESTRICTED to
 * `workspace` placements has no identity branch at all — not a branch keyed on
 * something better. Publishing this word to such a face ships a constant. That is
 * why `ActivityItemDto` carries neither this word nor a roster bit
 * (`api/attention.ts`), while `AgentRuntimeParticipationSchema` — a face that
 * genuinely admits `direct_pair` — carries this word and needs it
 * (`api/agent.ts`).
