// participates in it, in any position. What survives here is the grammar the
// renderer uses to draw a chip for a bare `@name`, and the composer uses to
// offer rewriting one into a canonical reference before send.
//
// It is a PERMANENT alias, not a migration bridge: a message body is immutable
// after insert (no write path anywhere sets `content`), so history will never
// become canonical, and dropping the alias would mean silently degrading every
// message ever written.
//
// The boundary check rejects emails (`me@x`) and paths (`a/@b`), and the
// alpha-first requirement rejects issue refs like `@123`. The inner name
// grammar is `PARTICIPANT_HANDLE_PATTERN`, shared with the stored schema and
// with the handle segment of a reference destination; this pattern adds only
// the boundary needed to survive prose. Exported as a SOURCE fragment (one
// capture group, no flags) so each consumer owns its own regex object and no
// caller can inherit another's `lastIndex`.
