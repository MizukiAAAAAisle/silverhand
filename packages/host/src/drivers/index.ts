/**
 * Host-side runtime Driver registry.
 *
 * PR-2 step 2 commit 2 — Cindy `vqDWkLFF6pAeIE5t` plan: runtime
 * drivers move to host (execution plane), prompt assembly stays in
 * backend. The split rule is:
 *
 *  - **Driver = how to spawn the runtime, what to write on stdin, how
 *    to parse stdout, when init is considered ready.** Lives here.
 *  - **Prompt = what text to put in the system prompt before spawn.**
 *    Lives in backend (`drivers/platform-prompt.ts` +
 *    `drivers/index.ts:buildSystemPromptFor`).
 *
 * Drivers no longer implement `buildSystemPrompt`. Backend calls the
 * driver to spawn AFTER it has assembled the prompt text and written
 * it to `spawnCtx.systemPromptPath`. This keeps the host package free
 * of `@silverhand/backend` / `better-sqlite3` dependencies (enforced
 * by `tests/dependency-guard.test.ts`).

   * WHEN a written payload is settled as delivered — the axis orthogonal

   * event flips the inbox row from queued to delivered* (i.e. lets the
   * daemon emit `runtime_delivery_consumed`, the sole trigger that sets
   * `delivered_at`).
   *
   * History: #task:1561 established a per-payload lifecycle gate for codex
   * (the `item/started userMessage` frame keyed by our payload uuid)
   * precisely because the earlier transport-level ack "let already-generated
   * sends pass" (countgame round 2). #task:2095 retired the observed-cursor
   * and degraded that gate to pure observation — the supervisor fell back to
   * treating a successful stdin write (or first `session_init`) as consumed
   * for ALL stream-json drivers, re-opening the same countgame class this
   * ticket fixes.
   *
   * shiki's ratified settlement policy has exactly TWO observable behaviors —
   * release and settlement stay independent (`releaseProfile` decides the safe
   * write window; `admissionPolicy` decides only the settle point):
   *  - `lifecycle-start`: settle after the runtime echoes the per-payload
   *    `input_lifecycle{state:'started'}` whose `commandUuid` is our minted
   *    `payloadUuid` — real evidence the payload became precedent context for
   *    the next generation. This is the fix #2210 restores. Applies ONLY to
   *    drivers with an explicit steer + correlated admission frame: claude,
   *    codex, qoder≥1.1.17.
   *  - `write-success`: settle the moment the driver's existing releaseProfile
   *    has released and the stdin write succeeds. This is NOT a re-assertion
   *    that a transport ack is strong proof — it is shiki's explicit product
   *    trade-off for fallback / non-steer drivers where no correlated lifecycle
   *    frame exists (opencode: ACP prompt-boundary release then write; cursor:
   *    one-shot argv; qoder<1.1.17: existing next-turn-batch release). The
   *    releaseProfile gate is what keeps the write inside a safe window; this
   *    policy adds no new deferral and preserves each such driver's current
   *    behavior byte-for-byte.
   *
   * No `turn-terminal`/`unavailable` values: shiki declined to defer any
   * current driver to its turn terminal and declined to pre-build concepts for
   * hypothetical future protocols.
   *
   * Version-bound like `releaseProfile`: a driver whose protocol capability
   * depends on the CLI version resolves this in `bindRuntimeVersion`
   * (qoder), so it is constant per process generation but not per class.
